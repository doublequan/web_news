 'desc': u'BornUnderPunches: The only reasonable move at this point, but boy does this hurt for Samsung. The stock crashed like 8 percent in Korea. I suspect the Note line might be dead now, but they will come back from this. \nFrenchFriedMushroom: I hope they dont discontinue the Note line. I love my Note 4.Maybe this problem will bring back the removable back, and user replaceable battery.\nT0mServo: Maybe this will push them to engender some customer trust by truly innovating and/or giving us what we want battery wise. \noURINEluck: You dont like explosive batteries? \nRefrigerizer: Now I really want a video game that has Note 7s as an equipable grenade-type weapon.\nSiberwulf: Like this? \nRefrigerizer: Thank you Internet Gods, for delivering once again.\nKarma_Puhlease: They always deliver; sometimes were just not on the page we need to be.\nCALEBthehun: Imagine that! I am currently using my Note 7 and I completely love it, except for the battery. I want a removable battery dammit. \nCondawg: Why would you still be using that phone? Not being snarky, honestly curious. Havent they come out and said just dont use it, turn it off, return it etc?\nbebop_cola_fizz: Im afraid its too late for Caleb\nFuckYouIAmDrunk: OP pls respond\nTravisx2112: His phone probably blew up. \nTasgall: OP is killF\nMrDadMan: Dude return the phone and get the S7 Edge or literally anything else. Its not worth the risk. \nruiner8850: I dont have one, but my issue would be that if I just bought a Note 7, I wouldnt want to downgrade to an S7 Edge that came out over 6 months ago. They should have offered an option for a temporary replacement that could be swapped out for the next Galaxy release when it comes out. Also, while its possible to get a refund, some people might have already sold their old phone so they dont really have an option to go back and they might not like the other options currently out there. A person might have just held onto their old phone and waited for something to come out later had they not purchased the Note 7. \nsalec65: I really hope this will force device makers to consider having replaceable batteries again.\nsharesomefun: Problems like these are hiding a larger problem. Manufacturers in cahoots with the marketers are using less of a design it to last moto in favour of the make it sell moto. They were never trying to design a phone thats sturdy, just something youll replace with another phone to keep money flowing in their pockets.\nHeartyBeast: It may force manufacturers with a reputation for battery fire to use removable batteries, I suppose.But I cant see it being a great marketing tool: Our phones come with removable batteries - in case we produce a batch of exploding ones.\n00DEADBEEF: This wont be the end of Note-like devices. Theyll just ditch the name and come up with something new.\noccono: Hah. I idealistically hope this encourages a return to removable batteries. I wish I had bought an S5 instead of an Xperia Z2 and now it makes no sense to go backwards and get one.\nwatermark02: Theyll probably release a new phone that fills a similar niche, just has a different name. In 6 months, that is. Theyre going to have to give up on this product cycle.\nhungarianhc: If they discontinue it, Im sure it will just be in name. Next year you will be able to buy a note. It just might not be called that. \nxgunnyx504: Samsung is the largest, most diversified and arguably the most powerful conglomerate on this whole planet. Theyre fine. \nDanielPhermous: The problem is that they  a conglomerate. Each sub-company is treated separately and Samsung  is the one with the stock price drop. \nxgunnyx504: They all operate under the same Samsung Group holding company. Theyre all subsidiaries, which means the group controls them all. They just werent dumb enough (and theyre proabably way too large) to bundle them all as one stock. All about the degrees of liability\nDeranged40: It doesnt really matter whether or not they bundled them all as one stock in terms of which stocks price reacts to what a company may do. The market isnt perfect, and stocks frequently see movement for things that other companies did.An example is how Teslas stock crashed after SpaceXs launch failure. Sure, both are owned by Elon Musk, but that launch failure was decidedly  the fault of a car company.Theres a company on the stock exchange with a ticker . They are not an automobile company, nor are they directly associated with the auto industry. Yet often times when Ford Motor Company (whose ticker symbol is simply ) makes a big move, this unrelated company gets a boost. So, while there are great reasons (mostly dealing with liability) to incorporate multiple different sub-companies with different tickers, this practice does not afford anyone the ability to protect one stock from reacting to another (possibly) similar companys actions.\nDanielPhermous: Control is not the issue. The issue is whether or not Samsung or Samsung Electronics is affected by this. If the former, then, as you say, theyre too big for it to make a dent. However, under corporate law, Samsung Electronics is basically an independent entities that shares a name. If Samsung Electronics goes under, the rest of Samsung is not held accountable (except in Germany where the laws are a little different).\nxgunnyx504: Are you talking about here in the US then? The electronics division is nearly 3/4 of their entire revenue, so yea it affects them. In the long run, they wont really be slowed down though. Tech companies are used to giant fluctuations in stock price when this kind of thing happens\nOwyn_Merrilin: Honestly kind of wish I had the money to gamble on the stock market. This would be a good time to put some money on Samsung and just leave it for a while.\nrandomkontot: Yeah, but youd need to be in a position to buy stocks at the Korean market. Its not just a matter of buying the stock you want, you need to trade on the market where the stock is. I trade in Sweden so I cant buy Samsung without jumping trough hoops. Otherwise I totally would. \ndrewdistilled: Youd have to convert to Korean dollars and use grey markets for the Korean stock exchange - way too much effort. \ncrayonofdeath: Or just invest in South Korea focused etfs, like EWY or KF.\nWhatsTheBigDeal: Or just buy Apple hoping that they profit from Samsungs sufferings...\nSasamus: Maybe you can, well not Samsung since as other have said its problematic to trade on the Korean market, but there are banks that have low fees.With my stock trading banks smallest fee package trades have a minimum of the equivalent of about 10 cents in fees per trade. So any sum more than that would be enough to trade with. Well, there need to be enough to buy at least one share but some companies have many shares and are therefore very cheap per share.Mine is Swedish though so perhaps not a possible choice for you.But there ought to be some banks that are interested in small scale investors in your country. Purely online ones are often cheap, just make sure they are legit.\nJDNTX: I would say that Yamaha is more diversified.\nJustifiedAncient: They always amaze me with their diversity and not only that but quite often their products are amongst the best in that particular category - pianos, guitars, audio equipment, tennis rackets, motorbikes... \nJDNTX: Agreed. Yamaha has been consistently one of the best multipurpose technology focused companies Ive ever seen, and theyve flown under the radar as far as most people are concerned.I dont know many people who realize the depths of their business model, but theyve got their toes into damn near .\ndetectivesonnybonds: Their jet skis are the shit.\nD1r3ctor: their motorbikes arent too shabby either\nGregoryv022: Their Saxophones are pretty nice too. \nPaumanok: Their budget guitars punch above their weight class IMO.\nwatermark02: I actually have a Yamaha saxophone. Nice instrument.\nifistbadgers: Their premium end basses are ridiculously nice.  as are their pianos.\nJustifiedAncient: Yeah, its basically yamaha or steinway. Doesnt get any better than that. \nborez: Fazioli, Bosendorfer, Mason and Hamlin, Stuart & Son, Bechstein,  Shigeru, Schimmel, Bluthner. All outstanding pianos I would rather own over a Yamaha given the choice. Saying that I wouldnt mind a Yamaha Grand either. ;) \nDWells55: Dont forget the absolutely glorious sounding V8 used in the Volvo S80 and XC90 a couple years back and the Noble M600 supercar. \ncyanight7: Uhh youre forgetting the Lexus LFA. One of the best sounding cars ever.\nClownWithCrown: \nJustifiedAncient: Haha, fucking hell. That escalated. \nstartsmall_getbig: They build ships.\n57ashdot: Nah. The previous versions of the Note were awesome. I have had my Note 4 since it launched with zero problems, other than expected drop in battery life after 2 years of heavy use. \nSkinBintin: You know, aside from the explosions, the Note 7 was pretty awesome too. In fact, if it wasnt for this it would probably be the best smart phone on the market.  \nalf0nz0: aside from the explosions is a helluva qualifier\ngaslacktus: Aside from that, how did you enjoy the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\nxanderg4: I think this is the biggest issue. Samsung, and Samsung Electronics, will weather this just fine. But the real damage is that theyre basically ceding this generation of high end cell phones. They wont be able to make up lost ground until the Note 8 comes out (which probably wont be called a Note 8).\nSideTraKd: If they do come out with a Note 8, I will buy it almost immediately to replace my Note 4.It will almost certainly be cheaper than it should be because of this episode, and I am betting that Samsung will make double sure that it wont explode.\nuacoop: Well I though for sure they would have checked and triple checked to make sure the Note 7 replacement phone they gave me wouldnt explode either, but here we are.\nSideTraKd: Makes me wonder if they thought they had the problem solved, or if they just thought it would be so rare that it wouldnt matter.Its just so weird, because they obviously are capable of making phones that DONT explode, given their success with the previous six iterations of the Note.  I absolutely love my Note 4.  My only problem with it is the battery is not living as long as it used to, but that is easily solved with a quick session on Amazon.\nuacoop: I think they just wrote it off as being a defective battery, when in fact there is a problem with the phones actual circuitry causing damage to the batteries. Whatever the issue is, I doubt well ever know for sure. But its a goddamn shame because this is the best phone Ive ever owned by a long shot and nothing on the market today is even turning my head...Im just going back to my old S5.\nthisiswhywehaveants: There were only 5 previous generations of the Note. They skipped 6. I believe this is because they wanted to push the edge on the 7 (that was still in development). So they skipped a phone and got one that blows up.\nSideTraKd: Oh, right on.  I didnt know that...  I guess I havent been paying to much attention to new releases, since I have been satisfied with my current phone.\nSoziele: Could also be a marketing thing,  people not buying the Note because it is a smaller number than the the other smartphones (Note 6 vs S7).  Someone not doing their research (or asking questions) might think it was an older device.\nTechGoat: Itd be hella nice if the Not A Note 8 has a removable battery, too. I laughed and laughed at Samsung for this form-over-function bullshit, and they got what was coming to them. All of this sealed-off crap is wonderful in the fictional world where nothing ever goes wrong.When something does go wrong like this, its $17 billion in the hole, instead of just hey, go back to whomever sold you the phone and well pop a new battery in there. Youre in and out in 5 minutesFuck sealed batteries.\nSideTraKd: Yeah, that seems like a horrible idea.Not to mention the fact that my Note 4 has locked up at least one time (my S3 used to lock up often), and the only way I could get it to reset was to take the battery out.Did they even have a supposed solution for something like that?\nTechGoat: To be fair,  there is a hardware hotkey function for that which is  built into all modern Android phones; i.e. the ones that are most likely to have sealed batteries. Ive had to use  once on my S7 and it worked fine.Assuming the phone isnt having hardware issues, the hotkeys mentioned here should always work, 100% of the time. Its like how pushing and holding the power button on a PC should  work 100% of the time; you shouldnt need to take out the PSU from the computer to be sure its fully powered off.\ndocmedic: Triple, apparently double doesnt do anything (replacements explode too).\nCentaurd: Hell Ill still buy a Note 7 to replace my Note 4 if they end up fixing the issue in a few months.  \nSideTraKd: Its my guess that they will ditch the Note 7 label entirely, and maybe even the entire brand of Note.  If their replacement program hadnt failed, then maybe theyd keep it.\nCentaurd: I can see them ditching the name or the brand but theres no way they stop selling 5.7 inch screen phones with a stylus.  These things sold like hot cakes and the reason nobody wants to return their phones is because everyone loves them.  Some people love them so much that theyre willing to take their chances with them not catching fire.\nRaintitan: No, not really. The S7 Edge is still a level competitor and the S8 Edge will be out early next year. \nExultantSandwich: Yeah. Its more like 5 or 6 months of missing out vs. a year\nTangpo: Best phone Ive ever had\nrobotrogelio: Theres been about 30-50 phones catch fire in all, including both recalls out of 2.5 milliom sold. I like my odds \nSkinBintin: You know, if I could still buy one, and it wouldnt affect my insurance if it did go up in flames, Id buy one still. Its gorgeous in hand, with stellar specs. Cant buy one here anymore though, and if it did burn down my house, insurance would so anything they could to get out of covering it. \npaffle: And you can replace the battery in the Note 4. It is a great phone.\ndraginator: Im so annoyed. Im still rocking my note 4 and I love it but I was finally willing to upgrade since they brought back the sd card slot and I really like the waterproof aspect. Looks like Ill be waiting another year.\nblagojevich06: I had a Note 4 since launch with endless problems that eventually forced me to replace it after 18 months. I think consistency is the big problem with Samsungs.\nbanedeath: I had the same problem.  I ended up getting a new battery on amazon for like 12 dollars,  back to normal. \nMaethor_derien: That is pretty much any phone.  The batteries themselves are only good for so many charging cycles.  If you do 300 full cycles(run it close to dead and charge it) you lose about 20% battery life, at 500 your at about 50% of original battery life.  Most people dont run them to dead every day though so you get more than that.That is actually the major problem with all the new stuff and why they actually build in the batteries.  It is not for the BS reasons of better life or a bigger battery.  That is pretty much a lie, they might get an extra 5-10% battery life building it into the device.    They dont want the phones lasting a long time because they could be resold or handed down which hurts profit.  The technology for phones has gotten to the point where a phone from 2 years ago is still going to perform perfectly.   They kinda hit a point where the processor is as fast as it needs to be to do anything you want to do on a phone about 2 years ago.  I mean sure you can upgrade to the newest phone and get a faster processor, but it is not really noticeable since the old one was faster than you needed for anything you could want to do on a phone. \nUncreativeTeam: Theyre coming down from an , so 8% isnt that bad in the grand scheme of things. Theyre basically back to where they were before phones started catching on fire.\nzephroth: it will be a delayed drop.  They will be reporting quarter 4 earnings and its gonna fall like a rock.\nSkinBintin: Their best device ever, is now their worst. Sure, theyll bounce back, in time, but its going to take awhile. \nXaphanX: They need to go back to the s5 and build from that again. Keep the removable battery and improve the phone in other ways. \nuacoop: Could you imagine how much of a non-story this all would have been if they had made the Note 7 with a removable battery?\nerilex_: I still have my S5 and love it. In my mind it was and is a perfect phone. Ive been disappointed with nearly everything Samsung has made since. \nNigmus: lets hope things go better with the Note 9.\nSuperlolz: They may not even have a follow up with the product line. Its a shame it ended on such a low note. \nNsena0: Its a shame because if I was going to get an android phone, the Note would have been my choice. Hopefully they end up making a parallel phone and call it something else if not a new Note\nSuperlolz: The   coming in early 2017! (explosions sold separately)\nAlisaLolita: Change it to 3017 and youve got a great Futurama product pitch.\nepicflyman: Primary reports indicate that the new Samsung etoN phones are occasionally .\njld2k6: They will probably just add an S pen to the galaxy edge line.\nCassiterite: Truly a shame. That phone was the bomb.\nhobo_champ: It exploded onto the market. \nCallate_La_Boca: That phone was on fire. \nNigmus: Im using a Note 4 and its awesome. its such a shame.\nsvenhoek86: Im going back to my Note 3. Best phone I ever owned, still use it as my tv remote. Had it for over 3 years and its still in perfect condition. Ill go back to not having an EIP payment every month over buying a new phone I dont even want. Try again next year I guess. Im not done with  Samsung, I still love my 7 and wish I could keep it, so Ill see what happens s next year and if they release a new type of phone that has the same features as the note. Fuck this sucks. I really wish I could keep this thing, I really do love it. \nloreonmoose: I love my note 3. I just wish it had the screen of the note 4. My wifes note 4 has a far superior screen.\nsvenhoek86: You know, Ill sacrifice screen resolution for no payments and a year wait to a phone I actually want. \nSquaresAre2Triangles: Replaceable battery, microsd, and IR blaster. This was the last phone that had all the things that made me love my samsungs in the past anyway, sadly. Hopefully if they come up with a new line or rebuild this line they will get back to those roots.\ncybersaint2k: My Note 4 is forever. I will keep it until it burns my house down. \nsvenhoek86: I would say the same about my 7, because I love it so so so much, but unfortunately my house will literally burn down if I keep it. FUCK THIS WHOLE SITUATION \nsilentbobsc: Love my Note 5. Second in the series Ive owned since my 3. \ncaptbritcorps: My note 4 has survived 100s of drops on concrete and has been dropped twice down the toilet and whilst its not 100% the screen never broke and it still works.\nkthomaszed: I see what you did there\nJustifiedAncient: Branding wise its gonna be tough. \nintashu: Now with the removal of the headphone jack! \nmat8675: Ha! My Note 5 is back on top!\nfiremanguy4: My thoughts exactly. At first I thought I got jipped because I have a 5 and they skipped number 6. I was like what the fuck, but now redemption. \nztc0611: Now if only I could get a new gold S-Pen for it.Seriously. They dont sell replacement gold pens.\nchapterpt: Samsung reverts to selling high-end notepads, made of paper. Also catches fire simpsons style. \nbiznatch11: \nviperex: Thats what happens when you scribble too quickly \nbenmarvin: Easy, they just sell the remaining stock of phones to Amazon to be resold under the Fire Phone 2 name.\n00nixon00: Or send it to the Samsung military division and use them as high explosive ammunition.\nnutmac: On a , Tim Baxter said (1:42) To be clear, the Note 7 with a new battery is safe. The battery cell issue is resolved. And this finding as been affirmed by recognized independent lithium ion battery expert.Does anyone know who this independent lithium ion battery expert is?\nNoFucksGiver: I dont know, but I have a lithium ion battery expert expert friend \nthat may be able to give a better opinion. Ill give him a call\nestuhbawn: hey its me ur lithium ion expert friend\nthe_Holy_Moses: I work at a prominent US phone carrier and I can tell you first hand that this is a bigger fuck up then you think. Yes I know Samsung phones are generally awesome phones and yea I know that Samsung is a huge conglomerate with many divisions. But consumers (for the most part) are stupid and get their information from the worst places. Ive personally met tons of people who have traded in their note 7s for IPhones and they claim they will never purchase a Samsung again. People who were on the fence between android and iOS, are mostly choosing iOS now because all androids are dangerous. Its a bigger hit to Samsung than you think, and even to all androids. Hell, our Samsung representative hasnt even set foot in our store in the last 2 months and he used to come 3-4 times a month. \nthealienelite: Can you tell me whats going to happen to someone like me, who wants to continue using my N7? My replacement is supposed to ship tomorrow...\nthegoodstudyguide: Probably be recalled again, theyve advised everyone to keep their phones turned off, including the replacements.\nCodeMonkey24: The news this morning reported that Samsung was offering full refunds or exchanges for anyone with an N7.\ntripppyz: If it hasnt shipped yet, then they will probably stop it before it leaves just like they did last time. I just received mine Friday, luckily. Unless my house burns down.\ngraphitenexus: They have/seem to be about to issue another full recall.\nsiphillis: I know, you make  exploding product line and suddenly youre not trustworthy.\ncancertoast: This is not the only Samsung product that has a tendency to explode.  The other is a washing machine.\nmercurly: Thats okay. If thats how they make their phone decisions, its better for them to buy an iPhone where all the decisions are made for them anyway.\nsealfoss: Better for them, maybe.  Better for Samsung? Im thinking probs nots.\ncancertoast: Their washing machines also explode.\nJoeSchemoe: Prediction: They make a new phablet line in 2018 that has most of the same features of the Note line such as the stylus, better heat control and battery, and some new bells and whistles depending on the time. The Note name is dead but it seems unlikely Samsung is out of the phablet market.\ndrdroid1: Galaxy s8 plus\nJoeSchemoe: Thats actually way too easy holy shit.\nWellPaidRichPerson: Easy lawsuit-Apple\nJoeSchemoe: You cant copyright a mathematical operation. Case dismissed.-judge\nMrAlbino: But we have money  -Apple\nEstidal: So do we\ndothefandango: Says who?\n-- Copyright Lawyers \nBig_Booty_Pics: Thats why they will name it the Galaxy 7s plus\nyaazz: Galaxy S8 Pro\nMartinVanBallin: They already have the plus series\nDisturburger: THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR IGNORING A NUMBER SAMSUNG!!! THE MATH GODS DONT LIKE THAT SHIT!!!!\nBloodyIron: Just look how its working for Windows 10...\nBEEF_WIENERS: Yeah but could you imagine trying to google for problems when you have Windows 9?  Google would autocorrect everything to Windows 98 or Windows 95.\nPisodeuorrior: I just wonder.. how the fuck did this go past QA? \nwelliamwallace: Because it only happens to one out of two hundred thousand phones?EDIT: Wow so much butthurt. I didnt say its OK to have phones exploding at this rate, I simply said the low rate is the reason it got past QA.\nBrassMunkee: That doesnt even pass six sigma standards, which is set to 3.4 defects per 1 million produced.\nmatuba: Guess someone is going back to recert for their black belt.\nInFury:  We have no idea if more time exposure will heavily increase the percentage. Is this something that if it havent happened in the first few months, it likely wont happen for the next few years or is it not time dependent and the longer you have it, the more likely it happens eventually? We cant make assumptions on that and neither can Samsung at this point as they clearly dont fully understand the problem. \nSssiiiddd: You do you test time exposure in the QA process?The question was , the answer  is perfectly reasonable.\nInFury: QA tests generally cover much smaller occurrence rates based on simulation driven from a smaller sample size, so it will be interesting to see if the percentage grows to a number that the public deems they certainly should have caught. \nPurehappiness: Is the one in two hundred thousand a Samsung provided number or an estimate based on reported failures? If it is the latter, we do not know what the eventual ratio will be, given extended time exposure.\ndigbybare: Thats great if you only plan on selling a couple thousand units. Doesnt work so well if youre selling 20 million units and 100 of those are expected to explode within the first month.\nWrenky: Its really rare, and is probably a combination of triggers.. not easy to catch.\njmeanz: ITT: People who have never worked in or with a QA team before.\nhashymika: Sad part is, it was quite a good phone... \nPirateNinjaa: Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\ndetectivejewhat: This is probably the best comment ive ever seen.\npretzelzetzel: I bet that joke dates back to Vaudeville.\ngoat_blower: i dont get it. can someone explain\ndetectivejewhat: Abraham Lincoln was murdered while he watched a play with his wife. Saying the Samsung is a good phone other than the fact that it explodes, is like asking ms lincoln how she enjoyed the play other than her husband getting killed.\ngoat_blower: oh right.  Didnt know that.\ndetectivejewhat: Yep. John Wilkes Booth walked up behind him and shot him with a flintlock pistol in the back of the head. He died (I think) the next morning.\njuanzy: Gotta love RedditIPhone: having to change the wallpaper in settings is unreasonable! Samsung: I know it blows up, but can you use it with an external battery. \n84626433832795028841: Seriously though I love this thing. I dont want to give it back ;_;... I dont want my house to burn down while I sleep, though. Dammit Samsung! \njohnmountain: Well, its been a blast.\nPepparkakan: Yeah, sales kind of just exploded at first.\ninsanetwit: Now theyll have a fire sale for the remaining stock! \ncerealkilr: You guys deserve more than youre getting. Maybe people are burned out?\nstill-at-work: What are the odds that the next galaxy phone they bring back the removable battery?\nztc0611: Probably low. They never learn.\ncart1yn: What a colossal fuckup.\nAltimaNEO: It might even be a Galactic fuckup.\nbaevar: I am Jacks complete lack of surprise.\nwhycuthair: Funny. Exploding smartphones would be something fitting to Tyler.\njt8908: I dont see what the big deal is. Im typing this from my Note 7 and havent had any problems or concerns about the phone explo\nKrutonium: RIP. Anyone got footage?\nXXTwnz: Gives new meaning to streaming live\nfuckingnihilists: I wonder if theyll rebrand the line from here on out. It seems like this could be a black cloud that hangs over the word Note for some time.\nsyncboy: I actually think that to the general public, its Samsung phone that has the black cloud.\nlanadapter: Or never use 7 again because that seems to be the part people remember more than it being a note\nthegoodstudyguide: I know Samsung will be fine but it  sucks that this happened to the Note series, probably the only truly interesting phone in the last few years.\nmegablast: How is the n7 interesting? It was just a slightly bigger S7edge with a pen? A nice phone, for sure, but interesting?\nvietbond: Well, at least I got a free 256GB  memory card and a $25 credit out of the whole mess.\nHungShark: What a shame. I was hoping they would fix the issue then rerelease it. I have been waiting to get a 7 for a while. Now I have no clue what to get. \nMartinVanBallin: The S7 edge is pretty awesome. Samsung pay is under rated and ubder marketed. Also, if you can wait 5-6 more months, the S8 will come out, and they may release the Note 8 soon to make up\nwoooden: Im quite happy with my S7. \nmoneyshift: Thats okay.  It will be back in a few months with a new name.\nCRISPR: I hate it when really bad things happen to really good lines.\nsharkiechic: Same. I really like my note. Guess Ill get the S7 Edge. I was on the fence between the 2 initially anyways.\nZglobtski: Just seen a television commercial for it 9 hours after the fact.. nice.\nCaDaMac: Damn it Samsung. Youre the biggest reason the iPhone 7+ is so good. Please keep the competition up. \ninterwebbed: Might as well. Theyre gonna have to amp up the galaxy 8 to make up for this note 7 disaster.\nCodeMonkey24: Which may very well lead to another similar incident, if they need to rush development to keep up with Apple.\nokoroezenwa: And there was a time they were apparently handling it well. Ah well, hope they do a better job with whatever replacement they come up with. \nfosterwallacejr: As a purposefully neutral member of the phone debate, and current iphone user, in the war between the two crowds of fan boys, i have to say Apple apologists are a lot quieter about this than I think the android crowd would be if iphones were catching on fire\nHelacaster: Good.  Now move to the note 8 with removable battery and bring back the fucking IR blaster! \nTallDarkAndBrittish: But.. But..I want one...\nNoobasdfjkl: Welp, I  thinking about moving from the iPhone...iPhone 7, best selling phone 2016\nDoubleTechnical: The iPhone is the best selling smartphone every year and nothing has ever come close. The 2nd best selling phone is last years iPhone. Apple sells more watches than Samsung sells Notes, so this really doesnt make that big of a difference on Apples sales.\n',

 'desc': u'behindtext: if you have the ability to generate your own custom DH parameters, you should do it, e.g. with openvpn.i noticed the article didnt mention elliptic curve crypto, but there are claims that the curves used with ECC suffer from a similar problem in that they were intentionally chosen due to having well-hidden trapdoors.\nDaSpawn: this is why the creator of bitcoin chose to use secp256k1 (Koblitz curves with transparent selection of primes) vs secp256r1 (random primes) as he did not trust secp256r1 for some reason\ncryo: I bet Curve25519 is ok.\nbehindtext: agreed, its the most transparently reasoned curve of the various ECC schemes.NTRU prime looks like a nice improvement over classic NTRU, worth keeping an eye on.\nmaliciousorstupid: Probably referring to the RNG dual_ec_drbg which is finally not being used, but was a standard used by a LOT of people (including RSA) for the better part of a decade AFTER being discovered to likely be compromised\nesadatari: If you plan on using DUAL _EC anything, be prepared to generate and use your own super primes.\nEcocrexis: Undetectable?I really doubt that. If it weakens encryption enough then people will look for it.Isnt it interesting that instead of protecting Americans the NSA would rather hurt them collectively.\nAngryPatriot: Note that undetectable may be debatable, but exploitable is a certainty.  \nIm_not_JB: I dont see what the point of this article is. They dont actually link to what is implied to be new research, and we have very little information to glean what they actually did. Sounds like they found a single trapdoored prime. Ok. Cool. Weve known about the idea of trapdoored primes for a long time. Why does the title even have NSA in it? This article has literally nothing to do with NSA. They even say:An honest title would be, Research in trapdoor primes continues, but were not going to link to the new development or even explain much about it; instead, well bash the NSA because thats politically popular and will get us lots of clicks.\ntemporaryaccount1984: Im sure the intelligence community appreciates your continued dedication to correcting their record whenever someone posts an article involving them on reddit. If criticizing US intelligence is so popular - I wonder why more politicians or journalists havent joined in on the fun. Fight-on young patriot, you are surely fighting with underdogs against the oppression the pitiable US government suffers.\nIm_not_JB: Im glad that you dont have a single criticism of the actual content I wrote. Its comforting to know that I was right. Im not in this to be pro-intel or pro-privacy. Im in this to be pro-truth... and right now, thats sorely lacking in the articles that regularly get posted to .\ntemporaryaccount1984: Its just baffling anyone has the time to write paragraphs about these topics even when no-one is looking at the post (like when it was heavily downvoted or whatnot). You have every right to, but Ive seen you misconstrue or misquote the article many times, and strawman the original article into a very different points. You clearly have a lot of passion (or investment) and time.\nIm_not_JB: Its just baffling anyone has the time to post all these articles. I mean, come on. If you want to accuse me of being a paid shill, just do it. No one will care, because its the stupidest, easiest attempt to discredit someone on reddit. Just dont be so coy about what youre doing.Put up or shut up. Give examples. Argue for your position on my statements. Support your arguments with credible documentation.\ngeekynerdynerd: Wait so there are two subs?  and  ? Maybe we aught to merge the two. Seems a bit redundant to have both separate. \nIm_not_JB: Yea, there are two subs, but for all practical purposes,  is the only one that matters (5M to 95k readers). I tend to use  as shorthand. Perhaps I should stop to prevent confusion.\ntuseroni: isnt half of the size of 2048 bits 2047 bits? each bit doubles the space of the previous...suppose 1024 is half as many bits but hardly half as large1024 bits support numbers up to: 1.797693134862315907729305190789e+308 while 2048 supports numbers up to:3.231700607131100730071487668867e+616and half of that would be:1.6158503035655503650357438344335e+616man sure would be nice if the government wasnt constantly at war with its people huh? \nbeef-o-lipso: What your referring to I have always understood as key space. In a binary system, adding a bit doubles the key space. I think key size and key length are synonymous (rightly or wrongly, I dont know) particularly when used by non-experts as in this article. \nBlack_Handkerchief: No.. and yes.The key  is the amount of bits the key takes up. 2048 bits, and 1024 when it refers to half the size.The doubling it up refers to the amount of possible keys. If you have 16 bits, there are 2 possible bit patterns. If you take one bit away, there are only 2 possible bit patterns remaining. It does not half the key size; it only halves the amount of keys that can be represented.Or, if that is too mathy of a response, think of it in terms of words. If you talk about a five letter word (dictionaries do not come into it, even qqqqq is valid!), then you can only combine letters in so many ways. Assuming 26 available letters, that is 262626 = 26 Each letter has 26 options compared to a bit which has only two options. If you take one letters worth of possibilities away, you only reduce the possibilities by a factor of 26. In this case, the length of the word is the key size, whereas the possible words are like the keys that can be created.Of course, this example isnt perfect. QQQQQ is not a word; it cannot be pronounced nor does it have any meaning. Similarly, there are mathematical requirements that need to be met in order to make a lock+key that is actually secure (as opposed to something that can be jimmied with a toothpick).\nPinyaka: When people talk about key sizes they mean length, not number of possible keys. So when they say double your key size they mean double its length. An actual factor of two in the size of your key space is insignificant.\nMahatmaBuddah: Lets face it, theyll always be one step ahead.\nDaSpawn: with the speed of technology and the internet the public has been on their heels much more often then in the past where information was less instant and much more easily swept under the rug\n',

 'desc': u'webauteur: You cant leave. We are not done spying on you.\nJisifus: Hijacking top comment to make people aware of this free, encrypted E-Mail service:\nXereyl: Discovered it a few days ago, in the intention to leave Yahoo.\nCan recommend, although it doesnt support third party clients like Outlook and Thunderbird.\nCameron_D: Theyre working on IMAP/SMTP support though!\nThePegasi: What do you mean working on SMTP support? How do they have an email service  SMTP?\nsmile_e_face: They said it a little awkwardly. ProtonMail uses its own scheme to keep your emails completely encrypted, even to the ProtonMail servers. You have to login once to your account, and then decrypt your mailbox with a separate password. As thats a fairly unique way of doing things, ProtonMail only works with their web and mobile clients right now. Still the best email Ive ever used, especially now that theyve got automatic filtering.\ndiito: The only problem is that they still need to communicate with every other email server out there. A large portion of that server to server communication is unecrypted, and once on those other servers its generally not encrypted there.  So all someone would need to do is sniff the network traffic between servers or gain access to the 3rd party server.  Its a fairly convoluted thing to do, especially if you want to see all communications to a person using an encrypted email, and communications between encrypted email users is protected, but still probably very possible for any government that doesnt care about privacy/its own laws and aggressively scoops up absolutely everything it possibly can.Still way better than no encryption, but until we totally replace email with a new set of protocols entirely that enforce strong full end to end encryption, encryption on disk, and a robust authentication procedure email cant be trusted. \nCameron_D: Well of course, but you cant send through it using a desktop client currently, just sending through their web interface.\nBohzee: So could I use it in outlook?\nTheWorstNL: Yes, as soon as its implemented. \nhonestjoe: Arent IMAP and SMTP sent unencrypted? \nCameron_D: IMAP can be done securely over TLS/SSL.For SMTP there is STARTTLS which most major mail servers probably try to use, but Im pretty sure it doesnt usually validate certificates. \namdc: But how do you have an email service without imap in the first place?\nrevnhoj: browser based.\nAstrrum: Dont forget that things are only truly encrypted between protonmail users. As soon as you send it out, its no longer encrypted on the other persons server. Even if its sent through a TLS connection. \nJiiprah: I was gonna say... encryptedand email dont really go together. Email was never made to be secure. I wish we would just move away from email but that wont happen.\ncalsosta: Everytime I say this I get downvoted to hell but its true.   Email needs a replacement. \nspaceman_sloth: Like what?\nJiiprah: A standard of communication built around simplicity and security.\nBuilding layers of security on top of email just adds complexity and inherently makes it insecure. \ntruh: PGP via email is just as secure as PGP via any other medium. Of course there is still meta data but that is really hard to avoid and as long both parties have a trustworthy email provider with transport encryption, its not really a problem.Im honestly more concerned whatever might replace email will just be a central instead of a open standard with many providers.\nPDNYFL: Exactly this. Email is an inherently insecure platform and if the people you send it to arent on this service then it isnt secure. While not as user-friendly you can just encrypt the content using something like PGP.\nxxb4xx: Is this legit? Sorry to ask, but its a little hard to always believe everything you see on the web..Also, is the free version encrypted? It only says the paid is encrypted for external recipients\nX-FER: It is. The people at CERN developed it.Edit- CERN and MIT\nKillerTuxedo: I have been using Protonmail since it was invite only. I waited weeks to get on, and it was so worth it. I use it all the time now. Its a solid email client, they have a great android app, and the best part is just the piece of mind. There are two passwords needed just to get into your inbox, and when you decide to encrypt, its 256-bit AES end-to-end encrypted. Plus, its based in Switzerland. Not too shabby for literally free.\nmbbird: thank you, but one thing: peace of mind, not piece of mind\nUbernicken: Well, you sure did give him a piece of your mind\nnuttierthanafruitcak: Which should have brought him peace of mind.\nselophane43: Imagine whirled pees. \nSuddenSeasons: How is it end to end encrypted if it still has to show up at the recipients address in readable format?\nlemoogle: Short answer: it doesnt show up in readable format , you receive a link, then you enter the encryption key/password ( ideally unique per email if were talking real end-to-end ). That key still needs to be shared between sender and recipient somehow ( unless the recipient is a protonmail user theoretically ).Long answer: Its not, not only can it really only ever deliver seamless end to end encryption between protonmail users( like whatsapp etc , which essentially do the key exchange for you ) but for non protonmail users there is no alternative have to also send the recipient a password unencrypted. ( Once you start wanting to do it for every email, it makes no sense and isnt practically usable).It will never be able to hide recipient and even subject due to how emails work, unless people accept getting a message saying you have received a message id=1024213 , enter the associated password for this message id to decrypt it and find out who sent it and what its about.. For example their terms and conditions state clearly that they have access to sender subject recipient data ( which of course they do ). Only the content of the email is encrypted and the recipient has to open a third party link to view the email , that is terrible email practice and probably generates bigger security risks in terms of learnt behaviour.\nCory123125: Whats the point of this if the email services of the people you send to arent?\nThisIsMyLastAccount: Gotta start somewhere, then you get more people on it, then suddenly your personal correspondence is actually personal! \nporn_syrup: You can send encrypted emails to other email services, but I believe it sends them a link that takes them to the password-protected message.\nVygotsk: ProtonMail is fantastic. Ive been using it since it was still using a waiting list during start-up. Switching to the new mail was very easy and both the online version and the app work like a charm! Those curious about the funding: the basic (free) account is limited to 500mb of storage and lacks the possibility to use custom domains. Plans start at a few dollars, no big deal. Check out their website, their security is extremely rigorous and even a bit James Bond style. (its data center is hidden in a nuclear bunker under the Swiss mountains. \nKYLO__REN: \u0ca0_\u0ca0If it was actually hidden you probably wouldnt know that.\norielbean: Tucked away or snuggled in is too quaint-sounding.\nFosnez: How do these guys make money?Perhaps they are yet to monetize their model How long will the service be around for?\npitchbend: Its not free, the free tier has very low capacity its more a way t\xedo try them and then go for any of the paid tiers.\nJoeyJoJoJrShabbadoo: Found the spanish guy \nBritishConfusion: Hes my uncle.\nSterling-Archer: Tio is very picky about his email services\nJisifus: Or maybe its because they have plans you can pay for... \nMINIMAN10000: \ndavebees: i find that people on reddit really jump at the chance to break out the you are the product line\ngubbinsmcgee: Which is kind of ironic as, well... Were on Reddit.\nlordvadr: Yeah, the site a at least some of us pay for.\ndaveime: Which covers about 0.1% of their running cost, hence the continued need for ads and their new gimmick of adding their referer id everytime you might buy something online via a link you found here.\nMason11987: Its because they think theyre clever when they say that, for the millionth time.\nxevz: It costs money if you want more than 500 MB of storage, amongst other things.\nthe_zef: Still more storage than my Exchange account at work. \nBoracho1121: They take donations from their site.  I dont imagine thats the  revenue stream they have though. \nRaticide: If they allowed a catch-all address when using your own domain then I would probably sign up for their paid plan. I use a unique email address for everything I sign up to and without that I wont use it. \nasaltandbuttering: If you cant review the code, you cant trust it. Whos to say that the NSA doesnt have a cozy relationship with this company?\nVorteth: How do they make money if it is free and fully encrypted?\nkellyzdude: Its the Yahoo California.You can stop logging in any time you like, but you never actually leave.\nEpistaxis: Oh, e-mail is still being forwarded. Just not to its owners.\ntemporaryaccount1984: This story was the last straw for me and decided to close the account. Unfortunately they wont delete it for 90 days!\nmecaenas: Its to give the NSA enough time to analyse your email traffic to locate your new mailbox provider and link it all together under your profile on NSA servers.\nzorn_: I did the same as soon as I saw the story. Hadnt used it in a long time, but fuck em anyway. Did it always take 90 days to close an account? I wonder if this is another temporary feature in light of the disclosure.\nBittoman: My last straw was when Verizon decided to buy them. I dont trust them anymore than I trust Yahoo. The two combined is just another level of evil.\nalphabetabravo: If Yahoo didnt turn my mailbox into a spam dumpster within the first month I had it, this  be a problem for me. Once I realized they seemed to be actively encouraging junkmail to fill my inbox, I decided thats all I would use that account for -- to collect spam.\nepsiblivion: aside from inferior filtering, theyve been compromised several times and not to mention wouldnt be surprised if they were selling info on users. dumped mine over 7 years ago\nBobVosh: I have it just to see how high I can get the spam count to.  \nsegagaga: Im at over 12000 unread emails, last time I bothered to look.\nhoogamaphone: I was at 180000 last time I checked. My account had also been accessed from multiple other countries.\nwelcome2screwston: Logging in to that account must have felt like being the fourth person in line to wear a pair of underwear. Id feel so dirty.\nBeepbeepimadog: Every major online advertiser sells your info.  Its completely anonymized, at least thats the idea, but its definitely there and sold.Marketers pay a lot of money to reach the most relevant audiences, so user data is used to more effectively target ads.  Turn off you adblocker, search/go on a bunch of sites that you dont normally go on (like cosmetic sites, or something) and youll start to notice almost immediately that your ads change.\nCyrexCore2k: 10 years ago I emailed support pointing out that if an email came in claiming to be from 2037 theres a good chance its spam. The support rep basically told me I didnt know what I was talking about. Thats when I realized Id use the entire email account for spam.\nthatneutralguy: You will regret that in 2037 when you find out it was true all along.\nxcerj61: We will have penis enlargement pills in 2037? only 21 years to go...\nbruwin: Oh man, I remember those days. I also remember that some of those emails from the future were literally labeled with SPAM! at the front and back of the subject line, and yahoo literally could not filter those out. Shows you how bad it was when they could literally say an email was spam, and it still wouldnt be auto filtered.\ntubadude2: I use my Yahoo account for anything that I think will get a lot of spam. \nSammyD1st: Alright, maybe someone can point me in the right direction here... Ive used Yahoo mail for a decade, and I want to quit.But all my  accounts across the web are now tied into my yahoo email address.  They use that yahoo email address as the login, the recovery, etc.So, anyone know of any ways to mass migrate those linked accounts?\nGummyKibble: Do  cancel your Yahoo account. When you start the process of doing that, they inform you that they re-issue usernames after accounts are closed, so someone else might end up with your email address. If there are any accounts youd forgotten to migrate to your new email, your Yahoo addresss new owner can do a password reset to take over those accounts.Delete all your email, your contacts, and your calendar but dont delete the account itself. Hold onto it if only so that no one else can claim it.\nkayardub: Damn. I wonder how many people have unknowingly had bad things happen to them because of this\nbruwin: Used to happen all the time with Hotmail when they were aggressive about deleting unused accounts.\nyuitimothy: Yeah, that used to be the best way to hack someones Facebook account.\n-littlefang-: Or you could be like the dipshit that wanted my Hotmail account so badly that he started signing up for things under my email without having access to it. I got so tired of getting his Facebook and MySpace notifications that I changed his password and set his status as something like hi my name is soandso and I refuse to get my own email address or something. I had to do that two or three times before he got the picture.\nbcrabill: Why the hell would the reuse usernames? Thats like reusing a SSN after the person dies. No benefit and only room for disaster.\nGummyKibble: Its a terrible, horrible, no-good idea and was widely screamed about when Yahoo adopted the policy. Thats not standard practice, either, as Gmail does not reissue addresses. \nmums_my_dad: You simply have to update all the accounts to point to another email address. I know, it sucks, and it sounds daunting, but, it really doesnt take as long as you think. Id recommend if you dont already, to use something like 1Password and change all your passwords as you go so they dont repeat. \nAfter the work you will be in a much better place. \nEurynom0s: And its not like you have to just close/delete the Yahoo account ASAP. Update your most important/most used accounts to your new email, and stop actively using the Yahoo account, but maintain your ability to log into it so that as you discover accounts you want to update to new email accounts, you can.\nPaDDzR: I have gmail fetch my yahoo mail and just change the account to my gmail, eventually Ill stop receiving emails there as everything will be going to gmail and spam wont be fetched by gmail. Thats the process Im in. \nenvious_1: I just started doing moving my dads email over to Gmail. Started by moving all of the contacts. Then started logging into his accounts everywhere and manually changing the email to his new one. Its not as bad as it sounds. While youre logged into all of these services, make sure you change the passwords too. No password should be repeated (dont use the same password again, every password should be unique). It will take some time, but you dont need to do it all in 1 day. I also would not recommend closing the yahoo account. Keeping it open does not harm you in any way since no new email  will be coming in. \nbonochromatic: Unfortunately mass-migration isnt a thing. Youre going to have to slog it out.I did it a few years ago; took me about a half-day and I got 90+% of my important stuff migrated. Make a big list, put it in a spreadsheet, and get started.While youre at it, this is the PERFECT time to start using a password manager like LastPass if you arent already.\nasuras1357: Melissa knows best. You dont need it.\nRodeoMonkey: Melissa Meijer?\nasuras1357: Melissa McCarthy\npsycho_driver: I thought she was too busy being devastated about finding that miracle weight loss secret that cost her her job on M&M?\nspambought: She was on Mork & Mindy?\nim_always_fapping: In the Streets of New York you out of place like MorkFrom Ork, dork, Paul pop the corkDrop me in Newark airport, Im supposed to meet Bj\xf6rk\nwickedpavillion: Fork man, that was good.\nStreamingPanda: No no no! Its Melissa Joan-Hart\nGletscherEis: Burn the witch!\ng0cean3: I always knew she was at the bottom of this\noscillating000: Nah. Youre probably thinking of John Goodman.\nTheHumanParacite: Melissa Melisson\niPulzzz: Melissandre.\nNergaal: Hey guys, Its ok, she had babies while working\ntheKovah: Turned off for new addresses Yeah, email forwarding always was a feature that needed heavy improvements...\nDroidLord: Theyre going to be improving it for a few years, until half the userbase has left and the other half has forgot.\nneocamel: I love that theyre acting like in order to improve software, they have to disable it from the live environment. Like they dont have a development server...Sorry folks, were re-paving this road. Im going to need your car keys.\nbruwin: Well they did shut down a fully function IM client and replace it with one that couldnt even see if your contacts were online. The old client hadnt been updated in a few years, and it was never the greatest, but it did work. The new one is basically just an email client... and not a very good one.Whoever is running their tech team over there is a moron.\nVROF: If Grandma cant forward her FWD:FWD:FWD emails about the Obamas not attending law school shes going to be pissed\njumpiz: Ive been reading it from my Gmail via POP3 since I got my GMail account. No need to forward it.Mostly using it for spam filter purposes.\nyouRFate:    EDIT: I have misread  comment. I thought he as getting his gmail-mails to his pc / device via pop3. However, he is talking about getting the yahoo mail to gmail via pop3. For this use case pop3 is actually superior.\nneocatzeo: Imap is pointless for this purpose.  POP3 only transfers email messages and not extra information like a complete heirarchy of email folders etc.If you are using an email app Imap is better.  You get better functionality.  But for just transferring messages between accounts all you need is POP3\nyouRFate: Yea, I misread  comment. I thought he was talking about getting his mail from gmail to his devices.\nneocatzeo: I was probably a bit overzealous saying Imap is pointless for this purpose.  Unnecessary is a better word.\ncdrt: I dont think Gmail supports that for getting mail from other accounts.\nCacafuego2: Really?  I believe you but it seems bizarre theyd support only POP3.Because its 1996?Because Gmail is still in beta?Come on, Google =)\nEurynom0s: Maybe Google only does POP3 to try to keep you on your Gmail account? Build up a host of non-IMAPed stuff thats uniquely stored on your Gmail account and it becomes a lot harder to leave.Anyhow I know I also had a hell of a time trying to sync my Outlook calendar to my Gmail calendar (I wanted to shove everything into my Gmail calendar with a work categorization so that Id have things like early meetings on my Smooth Calendar widget) to the point that I caved and called IT for help...and was told that Im not supposed to do that. Im not sure but maybe its related?\nneocatzeo: This is not the same as you using an email app to read your email.Imap is better for that since it syncs more than just messages.They are instead talking about your Gmail account fetching new messages from a Yahoo account.  Since you dont need anything but the message in this case, POP3 is all that is needed.\nVovicon: I think its a way for them to encourage doing the transition towards only using Gmail, rather than using Gmail as a mail client.With POP youll be able to get the emails from your other mailbox, but with some delay and in a not totally convenient way. With IMAP youd not see the difference between emails coing to your Gmail directly or not, and would have no incentive to totally migrate.\nsnort_: You are mistaken then. Gmail definitely supports getting all your sweet mails from any kind of account. I have my hotmail, yahoo, and another country specific mailservice accounts automatically aggregated by Gmail through pop3.\nAbnormal_Armadillo: I believe POP3 is a paid feature on Yahoo Mail (and has been for quite some time). As Ive said in another thread, this is supposedly temporary, and does not have an affect on accounts that already have forwarding enabled.Most people seem to forget that there was a time where Gmail didnt exist, and that its pretty easy to forget some of the services you may have signed up for over the years (but would prefer keeping access to).\nInternetUser007: And as I said in another thread (I think to you), Yahoo also said this: This feature is under development.Thats crap. Its not under development, they took it away. Email services have had forwarding for years. This is a blatant removal of features in order to try and keep as many users as possible until the Verizon takeover is finished. Its a business decision that screws over the users.\nTheKharmeleon: Oh dont worry, theyre just adding the new Freedom API so its easier for governments to read your forwarded emails just in case youre a terrorist.\ng0cean3: Very patriotic of them. Going to make a Yahoo! account as we speak.\nTopuKeko: Well yeah, if youre being taken over by Verizon...\nchuckymcgee: Hey at least its not Comcast.\nZOMBIE_N_JUNK: Most people wont even notice that the message arent being forwarded.\nredpandaeater: I probably have a spare Gmail beta invite if you want one.\nTheBeginningEnd: I think I have a spare invite only beta code for MySpace if you want to trade. \nLadyCailin: MySpace? Thats such a fad. Itll be gone soon. Friendster, though, is here for the long haul. \nSempere: Let me tell you about this college exclusive social experiment called The Facebook. Its going to be the next big thing.\nluthan: Holy shit thats quite a flashback \njumpiz: Youre totally right. I just checked and I dont even have it forwarding emails either. I dont even remember when did I stop fowarding them.My company uses Yahoo for business, it sucks balls big time, but they keep it because is cheap. Dont ever call customer service tho, awful.Still have my MSN.com email account directed to Gmail also.\nTheOtherSomeOtherGuy: Yahoo for business? Whos the yahoo that made that decision? \njumpiz: Every time you create an email account with your business domain you have to attach it to a Yahoo email account, its a pain in the ass.\ndoobyrocks: You might want to check out Edit: Thanks for letting me know about the link thing . This is the second time I noticed my app has a different (although arguably correct) behavior than the site.\nr3djak: Reddit is dumb and you have to put http:// before your links. So, \n-5m: Hmm I use POP3 on yahoo mail- but just like forwarding maybe they have disabled it for anyone who hasnt used it until now?\nSpexes: I remember finding a work around to use POP3 with free Yahoo mail. I had to change my regional and location settings to ASIA :DI always thought that put my in a different group, so they could scan my emails... Jokes on me! They were doing it the whole time!\neasy90rider: I fear that will not work anymore. I have problems using it via Gmail for the last month or so. It keeps telling me that Error: Server is temporarily unavailable. after I put my password. It syncs some email but still tells me that the service is unavailable.Whats funny is that 30-40% of the emails that go to my yahoo inbox end up in my gmail spam folder.\nNayr747: No one seems to care that every email service is almost guaranteed to be forced to hand over everything to the government too. Moving to Gmail or wherever wont do anything to keep your privacy from the government or the corporations it sells your info to.\nTThor: The supposed problem is that Yahoo is voluntarily giving the government access to your emails before you even read them.\nMacroMeez: Mostly i just dont understand the before you even read them bit.  What does that have to do with anything?\nCenturionK: if you received a letter in the mail that was already opened, wouldnt you be upset?Like, say it was just a letter from your grandmother. Would you not be pissed because someone opened your letter from your grandmother before you even got it in the mail?\nzushiba: I would be just as upset if someone came to my door asking me for my opened mail. Especially if that person felt he or she had the right to do so. \nneocatzeo: So what are they supposed to wait 3 weeks for me to check my messages?Them reading the message first as opposed to second changes nothing.  The important part is that they are reading the messages.  Thats the privacy issue.\nMacroMeez: as opposed to them waiting until i read it?  Email doesnt have the property of opened vs unopened.and also what makes you think any of the surveillance entry points into the other services have anything to do with whether youve opened it or not?\nAirHokie: Email certainly has this property, especially with all the prolific tracking features of the latest clients. I now track when an email is opened, how long its opened for, when its forwarded, down to location and time. So useful for recruiting.\nprecociousapprentice: Its not a property of email, its a property of the stuff you embed in the email.\naquoad: some email clients have those properties, but youll only see them if the recipients client supports them and is configured to honor them.\ntornadoRadar: I got bad news; chances are high that the main players are all doing it.  we just know that yahoo is.  \npintojeans: privacytools.io for private email\nNayr747: But unless everyone you email also uses it I dont see how that helps. Your data will just be collected through your contacts using regular email.\nTain101: Raises awareness I guess. But yea, not actually helpful at this point\nNadyaNayme: PGP.Theyll be able to see who you sent the email to and what time - but not the contents of the email.If everyone actually gave a shit about privacy this could be a solved issue pretty quickly. But people cant be bothered to use PGP because taking a few extra minutes to send an email is too much work for privacy.\nEurynom0s: So hiding the contents of email is obviously useful but I still think back to the phone metadata example I kept seeing from the start of the Snowden leaks. Basically, that if you call a Planned Parenthood clinic and then spend two hours on the phone with your mom youre probably thinking about getting an abortion and the metadata alone is enough to figure this out.With email I guess you could do something to the effect of obfuscating it with swarms of auto-generated encrypted email traffic between people (you couldnt just sign up for a bunch of spam because thatd be easy to filter out).\nmikbob: Send tons of emails which when decrypted have some sort of -IGNORE THIS EMAIL- message in them, then the email client is configured to ignore these for you\nhrkljus1: Check out , it does something like that to conceal metadata (its not auto-generated though, everyones encrypted mail is sent to everyone in the same pool but only the recipients can decrypt it).\nneocatzeo: There was an encrypted email service.  The operator could not read peoples email or recover it.  The US government was in the process of legally forcing the guy to hand over user data and at the last minute he shuttered the service and closed his company.He announced the move was meant to preserve privacy.\nMuseofRose: Maybe Lavabit\nthe_second: Actually, moving to Posteo does. You mailbox is encrypted and is only unlocked temporarily if you log in and read the mail. So, they give the data out, yes, but it is useless without your key.\npinglespingle: If only encrypted email use wasnt incredibly suspicious by the standards of an intelligence analyst.\nmadeamashup: The idea of having private data in the cloud is pretty ridiculous\nsjl127: If its in the cloud and you think its private, it is not.  Its just that someone hasnt found it yet.\njohnmountain: Agreed. Thats why you should move to . Or at least use .\npinglespingle: No one cares because theres no plausible way to stop it. If you were anywhere close to successful at getting people angry at this, youd probably be painted a pedo or terrorist by the NSA. Or exiled to Russia, or locked in an embassy, or dosed with polonium...\nJadeyard: You mean every American service.\na7437345: mail.ru\nAt least Mr. Putin is unlikely to respond to subpoena from FBI.\nChel_of_the_sea: I wonder if this is the future of subverting surveillance. Split your data among three mutually-hostile parties and hope they never ally.\npeg_leg: Jokes on you, theyre in cahoots.\nwhoamiamwho: I have a feeling since so much spam is sent from mail.ru, my email just decided that every message I get from a mail.ru address is spam and can go in the junk mail folder.That said, Ive never received a non-spam of mail from someone with that email provider, so maybe it would let that through.\nxcerj61: Out of the three-letters, KGB is my favourite too\nthe_second: If youre serious, Id recommend Theyre huge on transparency, dont store any connection between payment data and user mailbox and encrypt user mailboxes. Also they publish a transparency report every year.\nstrangeelement: Did Mayer leave Google because she wanted to do evil?\nxeromage: paid to run a rival company into the dirt?\nUrbanZenMonk: She wanted to implement her new aged business practices of firing men. Markets love it thats why they are booming.\ndarkstriders: Government wants to read email for legitimate target, fine. But the misuse is there. Add the Patriot Act and you get something leaning towards George Orwell era.And those who said I got nothing to hide, fuck you.I lived in the US more than 2 decades ago. Never committed a crime, paid, tax, yada..yada. 9/11 happened.... BAM! I got put in the list. I have to report IN-PERSON to the immigration office, report when I change my address and have to go through secondary checkpoint EVERY TIME I fly.When I changed flight in less than 24 hours notice (I was a consultant for almost a decade), I was interrogated..excuse me... questioned. Oh, and they know when I change flight, even when I only tell my client, SO and boss.All because I was born in the largest muslim country in the world and I own firearm.Hello, NSA!! You reading this, motherfuckers?!\nJanfox: \ndarkstriders: 10-4. Receiver order from Janfox. Over. EDIT: Sorry NSA, typo. \nBeard_of_Valor: Jokes on you, cunts! You were always the junk mail, from the very beginning. I got my Gmail account when I wasnt even in high school back when you needed and invitation, and kept it squeaky clean. I would go days without spam. Also I never repeated the username, let alone the password.\nOnyxDarkKnight: Man, my gmail has started getting spams recently like crazy :/ I have no idea what I have done to unleash this monster. Also, some of them are from me... Wtf?!\nBeard_of_Valor: You may have been hacked. Could be the PC, could be a breach of your nail account. Mails going out to all your contacts is one of the main reasons they add yourself to your contacts automatically. Thats how common and unsophisticated an attack you may be experiencing.Also job boards. You kinda expose yourself to every criminal and bot network.\nOnyxDarkKnight: Yeah, I thought I might have been hacked as well. Which is why I changed my password immediately after I was suspicious of some activity, though that didnt stop the spam. I am not very good with networking, I am just a programmer, but I assume that at this point there isnt much I can do to stop this, especially if they have my email in their system.\nXrave: ah. let me help you!Lets break down how you should approach this situation:Step 1: Think about scenarios where this is possible. Maybe, the hacker has your password and is listening in on you changing your password.thats pretty bad! thankfully, you can just use your friends computer to change your passwordStep 2: ask your self how? Do you have weird browser extensions? Do you have toolbars? Most viruses are actually just malware that you yourself installed. Google search See, if you were sending mail to yourself, either your browser is automating it for you, or a scammer has your email login.Step 3: clean up that virus! Run some anti-virus software such as Windows Defender, update windows to latest version, remove as many programs as you can without affecting your daily life, and switch to a different browser! Yeah, stop using that old browser, it might be infected and simply reinstalling may not help.Step 4: gmail is pretty good about spam filters, but you can also do a lot with your own personal filters. Read up on how to filter emails into folders (or in your case, the trash).\nTTSDA: Bullshit. The from field on email is not enforced or authenticated by default. You can send a message from any address you want. \nVikeStep: Check your email in this, I got included in the 000webhost breach and have been getting emails since then. \nOnyxDarkKnight: Apparently I got breached 5 times :/ \nEurynom0s: I had a nice Gmail email account until a club I did in college posted it online posted my email address because they listed me as the POC for that hobby topic at my specific college. I wasnt happy considering they never asked me first and I started getting spam. :/I probably would have started getting spam regardless once I started using my Gmail as my main email but the spam started at least a couple of years earlier than it would have otherwise, I think.\nLeapingLupine: Try tutanota.com for free encrypted email away from US jurisdiction. (not that you have anything to hide...).\nZilaan: Somehow this all reminds me of Hotel California by Eagles: You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave!\nwiddershins13: I have never had a yahoo account that wasnt a throwaway.\ndark_magi: Serious question, if this event were to theoretically damage yahoos profits to a point of significant loss, can they sue the federal government for causing them a loss by forcing them to comply with terrorist parsing?Edit: On this same subject, this could have happened to apple if they complied with that terrorist incident in san diego (caving into fbi demands to unlock the phone or implement a back door). What would happen if a company was financially destroyed because the government forced them to do something because of National Security or whatever they want to label it?\n9a45cf2daa7fbe: Yahoo is my main email and it has been for years. Im not really sure what to do anymore because everything single account I have is associated with Yahoo (ex: steam, origin, Amazon, Apple, etc..)\nZaldir: All those services allow you to change your associated e-mail account, so apart from taking a little bit of time (once), its not really a problem to change.\nIanPPK: Yup. It will be a short grind, but well worth it.\ndlatty: If you figure out a solution, let me know. \nanteedum: dammit, gonna make migrating my mother to gmail all the more harder. \nredconfetti: Can you use IMAP? You can usually transfer from one IMAP account to another in your mail program of both are configured. Its actually the best way to transfer IMHO.\nbenedictxxii: Well wasnt gonna leave now I will thank you yahoo. \nRDay: Enough of this bullshit. I just used that account for fantasy sports and Im not into that any more. Terminated.I dont even want Yahoo to have my GMail associated even with that mostly dormant account.\nOmniaII: Yesterday I deleted All my Yahoo folders, inbox, trash, sent, saved, etc., Ive had it for about 10 years but only ever used it to send links back and forth. I had 3 or 4 contacts.It never filled up with Spam I found that very interesting.Anyway, deleted the account and now  in 90 days its gone.\nLardzor: Anyone with a static IP could just register a domain and set up their own private email server.  It was good enough for Hillary.\nToaster-Six: Wow, thata dirty\nmjesmjes: Yahoo should show some honor and perform seppuku.\n',

They had a 3 strikes policy before they would start charging when I did go over 300GB. I would call support about it they swore there was no such thing as a datacap, yet I would be charged for every 50GB i went over.\nNinjaChemist: I can just imagine the incredibly frustrating circular argument with their customer service.\nS3PANG: Are you happy with the service you have been provided?!!!\nderpado514: , oh im sorry...You can always try signing up with <other ISP>...oh wait..we own them too!\nStovetopLuddite: \nTheDodgeIsALie: So they were happy to remove the charges since there was nothing to charge you extra for, correct?\nhatessw: They use the term data cap to mean cannot download more than. But you can. See, you just have to  for it.Not defending, just explaining how they twist words until they can rationalize cheating people. (I call it cheating as the term data cap refers to whats included by default. Their desire to use a different meaning does not make it a respectable definition to others, such as their customers.)\nDigNitty: Ah, not data caps.

Please and thank you. \nJonathan924: Id lead with Hi, Im calling on a recorded line, I have some questions about my bill, and when it shows up again, you ask to be escalated \n4theWlN: I went into my local office to get new boxes recently.  With all of the data cap talk I asked them what Ive been using for the past few months so that I could get a better understanding of how the data caps would affect me.  I was told that that information was not kept or accessible to them so that there was no way of knowing what Ive been using.  Fast forward 6 months and now Im going to be expected to be under a limit that I have no idea if I am close to and they refuse to tell me how close I am.  Help me Google Fiber, youre my only hope.Edit:  was able to find it on the account page now- this may be a new addition as when i wanted to find it over the winter they could not help me to find my numbers.  i guess i have it all wrong and comcast is in fact the most comcastic amazing company in the country /s/\nAddequate: Strange, my buddy in Shoreline received a letter saying hey were capping your data but you only used 637gb per month on average so dont worry about it. So... Somebody has that data \nFunfettiHead: That will change in the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years. This initial data cap is designed to be higher than what people use so people are OK with the idea. Later on it will be much closer to what people consume.Its a long con. Fuck these assholes.Edit: I wasnt clear. I dont literally mean the data caps will be smaller, I mean that data caps will be smaller . So, 1TB seems awesome now but what about when we are streaming 4K videos? What about when were streaming 8k videos and lord knows what else down the line? If our data cap only doubles while our consumption quadruples then they win out. \nDomini384: Try 1-2yrs, once 4k becomes standard and a 1TB wont mean anything\nLogicFish: Going off the Comcast What Can You Do With A Terabyte? video, they say 1TB is over 600 hours of video (undefined resolution) a month. So what this means that if they were talking about 1080p video that is 150 hours of 4K video a month, or if they mean 720p that is 66.66 hours of 4K video per month.\nsnowywind: If Im doing my math right then 1TB over 600 hours comes out to about 3700 kbps.In MPEG2 that would be 480p30 DVD quality, h.264 would be 720p60 or 1080p30 and h.265 might be able to hit 1080p60 with cooperative source material. This is with the huge caveat that all of those are subjective to the type of source material and the amount of time spent encoding.\ntuscanspeed: 480p30 DVD quality it is then.\nRainbowGoddamnDash: Thank God I cant see past 32fps\nStephonovich: 1080p wont look decent until at least roughly 6 Mbps video, not counting audio. Transparency is usually upwards of 10 Mbps.By decent, I mean passable HD that you could watch streaming and not bitch about. Yes, there will be banding and blocking in dark areas. \nbravadomizzou: Its none of thier damn business what I use the internet for. Its a shame that I have to have a VPN setup on my router so ISP will stop spying on my or injecting crap into my requests (ads/false dcma warnings)\nvectrex36: .\noneshibbyguy: 666 you say\nCrimyote: I knew Comcast was Satan.\nDomini384: Im assuming 720p\nBulletBilll: It was 240p video.\nDankJemo: No even that long, if youre a gamer and have multiple consoles or PC and take advantage of digital distribution services, (of course you do if youre a gamer.) Theres a good chance you will blow through this 1TB very quickly. For instances the new Call of Dutys Install footprint is about 130GB from the last report i saw over the weekend. Even if the installation package is compressed, youre still looking at downloading between 80 and 100GB. One game is over 1/10 your monthly allotment of data. Couple that with the increase of streaming habits per household and per individual, 1TB isnt really that much anymore. Then there is anyone who ever uses cloud backup services like CrashPlan or similar products that is almost a constant trickle of data thats being pushed up, god forbid you have to restore from it and sometimes pulldown as much as 400 gigs. It sounds like a like for a restore, but Ive personally run restores for people who were pulling over this amount, so its definitely not out of the question. \nthatguy2366: Exactly this.  This is to get the pssh I barely even turn my computer on why do I care about data caps? people whose eyes glaze over when you try to explain how and why its bad.\nRyupyroa: In Canada some of our providers have 50gb caps and go up to around 500gb before charging absurd amounts for unlimited.\nSixPackAndNothinToDo: We have data caps in Australia. Theyve gone up over time as the need has arisen, and for no extra cost.\ninhumanrampager: That wont happen in the States. If a company can squeeze more money from the consumer, they will. They absolutely will.\nUnckyMcF-bomb: Its unamerican not to keep the squeeze on, its their right to every last penny youve got .\nreddit_on_reddit1st: You can do anything. Grab them right in the pocket.\nJesus-chan: Its what our forefathers would have wanted\nintarwebzWINNAR: I mean thats why all their faces are on money, amirite?\nKedriastral: TIL Verizon is American\nbonked_or_maybe_not: Only true when government enforces a monopoly as they have in Cable/Internet.\nsbeloud: Isnt comcast already raising their cap from 350 to 1TB?  Im not getting a new cap in my area, are they charging more for the 1 TB vs the old 350?\nKYLO__REN: Thats because theyre arbitrary on residential broadband service. for no extra cost means nothing.\nAzureProdigy: Actually a lot of ISPs have been rolling out unlimited recently. I just got unlimited 100/40 NBN from iinet.\nbigswisshandrapist: Is it?  The initial limit was 300GB.  Im 100% against the limit, but seems disingenuous to say that.\n4theWlN: Just apparently not the people working the computers at my local comcast office where you exchange hardware....\nben7337: Doesnt your online account show that info? I had comcast at my parents house years ago and it had a 450GB data cap that was never in effect or enforced but was noted by comcast as able to be enacted if they ever wanted, and they had a past 3 months record on there for you to see your usage. Id be amazed if they didnt still have something similar.\ngetMeSomeDunkin: Comcast sent me an email about the 1TB cap and that my monthly usage was 264GB.Gave me a bar graph and everything.\nNFN_NLN: Assholes!  I wanted a pie chart.\nNexant: Everyone I know on Comcast has received that letter.\nsbeloud: I havent.  I think thats because Im not in the new cap area.\nAZNundercover: Received same letter.... was told 256gb a month on average.\nasforus: Your unused data should roll over from month to month. You are essentially paying for it. \nspam99: I saw something a few weeks ago about this and logged into my xfinity account, went to internet, and there was usage and a place to get break down even. I was usually around mid 300gbs.. but one month .. August or September.. I used 937 gb.. so thats too close for comfort.. since I barely do anything by my standards.. as I could be streaming HD yet I choose lowest fucking setting.. anyway.. caps are bs and speed caps are bs.. im in New Jersey by the way.\nHusker_Red: Caps are bull, if they are going to pull this shit but still want tv customers w internet then start broadcasting in 1080p and 4k \npeevee78: The Comcast app used to tell me my monthly usage. Now that the data caps are real, oh, sorry cant find that data anymore brah\newwiccc: \nIsrarK: \npaperhousing: try . it monitors your traffic on eahc computer in your network, not great, but I use it to make sure Im not screwing my roomate over on the data caps (that and to make sure suddenlink isnt screwing ME over)\ndatusernames: except comcasts data recorders are broken as shit, and that will not reflect what comcast says you used.  \ndevon223: Ive been able to access my usage on their website for years, thats strange. \nHandsOffMyDitka: Mine wouldnt show up for years because I had my own modem and router.  They finally updated it to show my usage. \nDreadBert_IAm: Last I heard it was not what your devices used but traffic hitting the modem.  At any rate Ive had win10 glitch and peg out a 10mbps connection for hours downloading a patch (1kbps to HD) so not looking forward to TWC pulling this. \nMetalPirate: They cant, at least not for 7 years. Its a FCC regulation as part of them buying Charter.\nCrazyalbo: The result of them buying charter should have been a nationwide breakup of their god damned corporation. How can the FCC allow such a huge consolidation of marketing power and internet availability/support. \nDreadBert_IAm: Joy, now I just need to find the correct dark god to pray to for them to update infrastructure so I dont drop packets at peak times.\nOrpheusV: I had that exact issue. While Im sure its windows 10 itself, if youre hooked up to your router/modem via ethernet, buying a NIC might solve that issue for $10.\niLuvDaNet: My average according to Comcast is 1.2tb per month and I am in the top of 1%.   I have a firewall with logging on it so I am now looking at a $20 overage or paying their $50 unlimited plan.    I pay for the 150mbps plan I think that should get more than a 1tb per month. \nNFN_NLN: Username checks out.\nstonebit: Have you tried logging into your account? \nZ4XC: You can find it on their website when you log in to your account. It stupidly isnt printed on your bill though. \nThaliur: Check your router. There will probably be some Overhead missing from the total amount, but for a General estimate, it should be Close enough.\nyoureoutoffocus: You can check your data usage by signing in to your Comcast account and clicking on the devices tab. Tt shows a bar graph of usage per month. \naustin713: its in your account online under useage details. \ngandalfthewhte86: There is a way to see how much data you are using from within their website. Its just not intuitive. I think I usually just search for it.Edit: \nmaplemario: Mine shows up on the online xfinity portal. Weird. \nupsidedownfunnel: Comcast has an online tool to check past and current usage. Im. It sure why that associate couldnt help you.\nsimpleGizzle: If you pay your bill online it tells you too how much you are using. You can even calculate how much you use a day. \nSynbiosVyse: Comcast has the usage on your page, its not that hard to find.\nffilps: i dont know how your connections works, but if you have a quality modem/router, you should be able to log all incoming/outgoing traffic and have it cumulated at the end of a month.\nX90210: If you really need to know, many routers can tell you traffic used and can even limit in the same way Android devices do. Personally, having to watch bandwidth is like paying for internet by the minute. Do not want to return to that. \nPanaphobe: Didnt Google Fiber announce that they werent going to expand anymore?\nFalkalore: Fuck, I dont even have comcast and they piss me off. \nTheSleepingMonk: You can download the app to your phone or check their website to see your usage. But how can we trust them when their services dont even show the . July must have been a weird month at my house...\n007a83: Check your Comcast email account. Thats where they sent mine. \negenesis: Folks in Arvada, Colorado. Dont forget to vote to opt out of Senate Bill 152. This means city can start working on Fiber\nDigNitty: I wonder what the logic behind not allowing new tech is.\nMetalPirate: The lobbyists have lots of money.\nHappyysadface: Powerful people are making more money not allowing at and are too shortsighted to see long term gains\nfatcat99: Capitalism ruins most logical thinking \ntroglodyte: At this point ever suburb of Denver will have municipal fiber before Denver even brings the issue up. Getting really frustrating, honestly.At least Denver has CenturyLink-- theyre slightly less evil than Comcast. Theyre arriving tomorrow to switch me over. I refuse to do business with Comcast with them pushing this blatantly illegal deal.\nhaltok: Not being a jerk, but what makes what Comcast is doing illegal?  \ntroglodyte: Comcast has capped data usage, but data from their services does not count against the cap, which is very similar to what wireless carriers are doing.Zero-rating data like this is clearly against the spirit of the net neutrality regulations, and many likely are actually illegal. Heres a good primer from . The problem is that Wheeler is on his way out, and challenges simply havent been heard yet.\nFleaHunter: And now there is a national Comcast outage affecting many including some non-Comcast customers. Would be real funny if those data caps somehow got imposed on their public peering...\nProjectSnowman: This would not surprise me in the slightest. ISPs make stupid mistakes all the time. \nSnipeGSMC: If they are going to shove metered usage down our throats then we should demand a standard of measurement with a certified meter that the user can monitor just like any other metered utility. Comcast has already been caught billing for erroneous data usage, and just maybe we can make it enough of a pain in the ass that they drop this gouge on the consumer. \nnailz1000: Its called Netflow and you can get it with many free systems out there, most popular now is pfsense.\nSnipeGSMC: Yes I understand there is software that will allow you to monitor your usage, but until there is a unified standard of measurement and certified meter the ISP will simply state your measurement is wrong and to trust them you owe them more money. \nretardsan: This would work. \ngarrettcolas: Beat them at their own game, nice!\na_wild_fuck_you: This is going to screw poor people the most. My mom has 6 people living in her house, two unemployed. Two work online. They watch a lot of Netflix and easily would go over the cap. Of course, Comcast bought out all the competition in the area.My cap with AT&T is lower than that. Service isnt much better than Comcast. Google needs to hurry up and finish laying fiber in my city! \nAlarid: Google needs to give me all the Fibre they have, so I can finally pass this shit!\nzigzagdance: Fear not, Comcasts streaming service wont count against the cap! They really care about you. /s\nArrrGaming: I continue to not regret at all refusing to patronize comcast. (and I realize that many dont have that option!)\nCecily011: I can pay $80 for Comcasts 100mbps plan, or $60 for AT&Ts 6mbps  plan. Those are the options in my area. Save \nwithinreason: Google is pretty much done rolling out fiber. \njessestephens: Ting is doing it now...\nSave us ting.\nMidEastBeast777: Comcast is literally my only option. To be fair tho, I honestly havent had a problem with them. I never hit their 300gb data cap, but IM JUST ONE PERSON AND I DONT REPRESENT AMERICA. Ive had billing issues with them that were resolved without issue. I dunno, maybe Ive been lucky.Also, last time I posted something like this I was downvoted hard, probably because it goes against the circlejerk of how Comcast is Hitler. Id gladly take Google Fiber if it ever makes its way to Chicago, but knowing how corrupt everything is here, that prolly wont ever happen.\n(5 children): \nMyBetterSide: I saw this on the front page, submitted previously by , but it was removed due to title editing (rule 3) about 15 minutes ago. Im resubmitting it for visibility with the title unaltered.The original post: \nDonutPills: It blows my mind how they would shove that down like that. Its affecting millions of people and need to be shared as much as possible to raise the level of awareness\ntwoods450: I posted this in  last week after  removed it because I had less than 10 total karma.... at the time I was well over 10k karma. Mods never responded to me, and their bot is running amuck. \nLokki007: Chicago here. Went to a Comcast couple of weeks ago to cancel their service. CRS asked why do I want to cancel it. I answered You guys jumped over your head this time with 1TB data caps, its just not going to work. He responded: Well, buddy, 1TB is WAAAAY more than you should have been using. \nHe said we are losing money on this. Lol, now they lost my $90 months. Super happy with my current deal though) 380Mbps for much less money. \nGood luck, Comcast. I hope you die)\nBigBearBeer: Who did you go with? I am in Chicago and would love to dump Comcast..\nBellyheart: Theres absolutely no reason that theres a data cap other than capitalism.  There are more restrictions on broadband than the non-renewable energy sources.  Article posted here a few months back:\n\nbbqroast: Monopoly who is interested in profit, nothing more to see here.New Zealand, which has a competitive broadband market, had caps up until recently. Because wholesale bandwidth cost $30 per mbps of capacity per month. Now it costs $10-20 and unlimited is standard. Meanwhile in the US it costs <$1 and apparently ISPs cant afford enough...\nDomini384: US is more spread out, but still its no excuse\nTychus_Kayle: The thing about it being spread out is that doesnt explain why internet is crappy and expensive even in high-density areas.\nAlexrocksdude: Because most ISPs would rather spend money lobbying than upgrading infrastructure.\nBanned_By_Default: It still baffles me that the anglosphere, as mighty as it is, is still on data cap.Even Romania is well supplied with fiber cable at a cheap monthly fee.I still curse my phone provier over the cap on moblie data rather than going back to speed cap. Id survive on 1mbit/s and less.\nDomini384: 92k sqm in Romania compared to 3.7mil sqm in the U.S.\nShenBear: But the US easily has more densely populated areas. Cost-to-use ratio would favor highly populated cities having fiber everywhere. Its business practices which limit the fiber in the US. Yes, rural connections are an issue, but you dont start there. Give it to the urbs and suburbs first. \nEverythingIsSFWForMe: How about Russia, then? (>6m sqm)\ncryo: And I bet most of that isnt in any way supplied with fiber cable.\nsamharbor: Yeah but didnt that start with Romania connecting directly together and having fast speeds from the get go really\naapowers: UK doesnt tend to have data caps.Rural areas can be a bit hit and miss when it comes to speeds, but most metropolitan areas have decent fibre internet.If you can get in a Virgin area, youre looking at 50Mb internet, and 80 channel cable, for \xa312 a month (first year).\natz3ro: This is a government created monopoly. Of course its capitalism, but capitalism simply means that the ownership of capital is private rather than by the state. What we need is free market competition. The most effective thing we could do to make the telecommunications industry better is to eliminate all regulations on telecommunications companies and have complete free trade.And yes, as someone said, Comcast will likely buy Time Warner. But if there are no restrictions to who can compete, any other company is free to start up and take Comcasts business. Google Fiber is doing precisely that. Google fibers main reason it doesnt spread more rapidly is because of all the governmental policies making it extremely difficult for new companies to enter the market. So let Comcast buy Time Warner, as long as you eliminate all government regulations that stop companies from entering the market. \nddelux: The problem with this argument is that it takes a MASSIVE upfront capital investment to put the cabling in and several years of effort.I think a lot of entrepreneurs will pass up this opportunity for an easier market to enter.\nKensin: Thats insane. Nothing would screw over consumers faster. The problem is that we have too many regulations written by and for the telecommunications industry and not enough regulations protecting the public.  Get rid of the regulations that hurt competition and allow the industry to provide substandard service at exorbitant prices but increase and strengthen regulations that force ISPs to adhere to net neutrality, and keep your data, your network traffic, and your personal information secure and private. \ninnyoutty: Just the first step in a pricing structure that will be designed to maximise profits. Sorry to see you stepping backwards. Now you can be like Australia, where we also have caps on our slow ass internet. \nNovaslogic: Comcast data meter isnt accurate. Ive seen post where people use their data meter on like openwrt and ddwrt and it shows data way below what Comcast claims. \noneshibbyguy: This should be illegal. Its wrong. Its immoral, and its just plain rude.\nOminousHippo: Here I am using 25% of my data cap and still getting 10% of my advertised speed...\nkRiiLiiN: Either swap out your modem/router or talk to your ISP. They sold you a product and have failed to deliver. Call their support and demand a refund or an adjustment to your plan so that the bill is in-line with their service. You can take this to small claims court if they fail to make a change. \nzenthr: Its a cost preventive feature! If you got 100% of your bitrate, youd be 150% over, costing you lots of money. :( Instead, you can relax, knowing that there will be no unexpected disturbances! :)\n3mnmnms: Everybody contact your representatives! Thats the only way this will be stopped.\nSymphonic_Rainboom: Where do I go to do this?\nACNite: Use the zip code function to narrow it down.\nPosthumos1: How can this company possibly make itself worse?.... Oh...... This.\nHouseBoltonForLife: BURN IN HELL COMCAST\nAnon_Logic: Just need someone to start up Project Mayhem...\nInspecterJones: The only time I feel good about having time Warner is when I read about Comcast. \nfatmoonkins: Doesnt seem very fair to charge you extra just for using their service.. good old Comcast.\nscoperson: Lets say you use all 1TB of data this month. How much of it went to unsolicited advertisement content out of your control? Or automatic updates to software/games? Or even malware performing data transfer in the background?\nBLAZEoneK: In Michigan - can confirm. Just got the email last Friday. Capped at 1tb. Thanks Comcast. Please google help me. \ncooldito: Same in Denver. I use around 1 TB a month, my moms on disability and lives with us, so we go through a lot between all of us\nGrumpkintheGreater: So when do the pitchforks come out again?\nUmm_NOPE: If youre around LA area, Id recommend getting Sonic, an lesser known ISP. Around 50 bucks a month gets me unlimited Internet at reasonable speeds. Sooooo pleased with the service so far over Time Warner or AT&T. \ntylero056: I think we all can agree here... Fuck Comcast. Data caps are a complete joke. They literally serve no purpose aside from getting extra profit because they can. Its a complete monopoly. Where I live, until fiber came recently, it was literally our only option, and since we needed internet we had to go with them. I hope that somebody passes some sort of law to combat things like this.\nSurakiDK: Remember to keep sending requests to the FCC.\nSesleri: Recently moved to Atlanta area where they have enforced their caps for a while.  First few months it was actually 300 GB which I hit every month.  Now theyve changed it to 1tb which Im close to hitting.Google just installed their fiber outlets in my apartment though, so bye Comcast!\ncubemstr: Wait, what? Comcast enforced caps in an area that Google Fiber serviced?How fucking stupid can they possibly be?\nSesleri: Google is just now moving in.Local TV and radio are filled with anti Google comcast ads, serious.\nImpuredeath: Why not bring this subject to the political candidates, I am sure since they use the internet so much they will be able to respond (at least trump, that guy is on twitter 24/7 it seems). This is some 3rd world country level shit, and really sends a pathetic signal to everyone (corruption/monopoly). \ncaptainahob: Fuck you comcast\npotatoguy: Fuck comcast\nRudeTurnip: Meanwhile, their own television service, which is also data, has no data cap whatsoever. You can leave your cable box on 24 hours a day, all month and your bill will be the same. That seems like an abuse of monopoly power.\nhostile65: I want someone to use the ADA against Comcast for this.\n(15 children): \nklezart: Why not, just... download a fireplace video and loop it on your own computer?\nPokingPanda: Holy shit guys why do you deal with shit like this, i live in a smal eastern eu contery called lithuania and have 1Gbps up and down with 100 chanels iptv pay 13eur about 14.30usd with no data caps or closed ports they only do that to you cuz you let them, you have to stand your ground on shit like this or soon you will pay for the air you breath.\nS3PANG: Hard to stand your ground and whatnot when you literally have no other ISP choices available. Standing your ground means having no internet whatsoever, cant do your job cant communicate, nothing.Choices do not exist in many Comcast areas.\nCuddlesMcHuggy: Theres literally nothing to do about it unless youre willing to commit terrorism...\naustin713: yea... notice all the people in this thread asking for google fiber. its because its not available in 90% of the places in the US. its either Comcast, who has superior speeds and now data caps, or Att who has shitty speeds and even lower datacaps. \niluomo: How do you guys stand your ground?\nTheLawlessMan: Stop posting this shit. There isnt much the average person can do about it. Stop it. \nG65434-2: \nosirisguitar: Just got my 1Gbps line. So that could cap me out in 18 minutes (this is Sweden though, so no caps except on mobile connections)\nnyrol: I think you mean 2.5 hours, but yeah, thats pretty quick.\nbrosiff420: I got an email as well... 1.365TB last month and averaged over 1TB for 3 months. But hey, Im finally in that elite 1% of Americans lol\nAgentButters: As well as forced upgrades to X1. Im sure my bill wont go up in the slightest. /s\nDr_Gats: yeeeahhhhh. I literally have half a TB for a cap...you know, one you can actually hit...regularly? Here I am a good consumer, happy that they changed their overage policy recently too (provider is GCI, Genercal Communications, Inc). I get an extra 50GB for every $10 I huck their way, they call them buckets of data. (For reference I work in IT, with experience in our local ISPs as a network admin, although not this provider.)Before this wonderful policy, they could charge you for every MB over your limit, without alerting you that you went over. My normal bill is $135/mo for a 100 meg pipe. Before I would often get surprise bills for $300 or more, because my wife would be home sick and pull a netflix binger, or a houseguest would torrent a bunch of shit and not even tell me. The worst part was, the $.002 or whatever per MB that they charged didnt seem so bad on paper, but added up quickly; and if you had the GALL to get standalone service (not bundling internet with their cable/phone/mobile), they would not only charge you extra fees per month AND a higher rate for the base service, but they would also DOUBLE the per/MB overage fee. So I literally got dinged three times for the audacity of not wanting their television service. So Ive been trained to be HAPPY (hint: Im not happy) that they now automatically throttle my internet connection when I reach my cap, and ask me to buy more data. The best part is, they throttle me at 90% usage too, to warn me that Im getting close. This comes in the form of a shitty redirect, that doesnt always work, and I have to spend 15 minutes trying to get their page to come up just so I can click OK, please let me use my internet. Until I get that redirect, everything in my house that uses internet just goes haywire because they block selectively, to allow you to get to their website and buy that bucket of data. My Hulu/Netflix will load but wont play, cell phones wont update unless I turn off wifi, and most things that require a login for authentication (battle.net, steam, etc) will not authenticate. Keep in mind, they tell me Im supposed to be throttled, not blocked. Things are still supposed to work, just very slowly. They do not.The funny part is, when I do get throttled and things arent working, if i try to go to their website and look for the button myself, its not there. You can get to your usage page, or pay your bill, but you HAVE to wait for their redirect to kick in and give you that special warning page before your internet stops acting screwy. So even if I KNOW Im over my limiit, I cant fix it pre-emptively or on the spot myself. This has been going on for years./rant\nteawithdinosaurs: 1TB aint shit. Comcast its 2016, not 2006. Even 3rd world countries are beating you.\nwookie_walkin: So does this give users the right to cancel contracts? I have had comcast for about 2 months but i took a year contract\nin_theory: Yes, of course. Any contract change gives customers the option to not accept and to back out of the existing contract.\nDyingWolf: I still had to pay to get out of my contract. But it was worth. I was livid when I got the email about the data cap. No thanks motherfuckers. I left for att. Luckily they had a gigabit service to my house without a limit so it was a no brainer for me\nInitiatePenguin: I would still prefer a 1TB cap than my Familys 250GB cap from our local monopoly. Which weve had for years. \nOttobawt: As a Canadian, who already has caps, is paying for 400gbs, and watches a ton of videos and games, 1TB seems pretty comfortable.   Caps are BS, and I hate Comcast, but still, could be worse... \nBut when 4k content comes wide spread... might get tight.\nTenn1518: You also have to understand that while youre using 400gbs now and 1tb seems like a reasonable amount; after many years youll definitely be exceeding or close to exceeding 1tb every month, but its fine for Comcast because it was fine a long time ago.\nsatellitesinger: Yea could be worse. Like having fucking data caps in the first place.\nBond4141: As a Canadian with no cap, I go over 1tb a lot...\nmerelyadoptedthedark: I was so happy when Rogers finally let me have a whopping 320Gb per month.  I had a 160Gb cap for years.\nWhisky_Fan: The new cod game will be 135 GB download.\njoper90: Do you have a partner and/or kids???\nEtherBest: As someone who is moving to a place where I cant even get DSL, only Comcast, this infuriates me \nPatrickShatner: In Canada average is like 200 gigs with a package.

The thing is... they know theyre shitty... and yet they dont give a fuck.\nchoicesmatter: Thank you Chattanooga Electric Power Board Fiber Optics Internet with no caps and 24/7 immediate service. You guys rock. \njafhsdf: Pennsylvania is still off the list... for now.

I wonder how fast they would go away...\nprimo_pastafarian: If they are going to charge people extra for using more data, then they should charge people less for using less data.\nclaireapple: I have comcast, but still currently have no cap. I assume it is probably becausr of the two fiber companies that are in the area.I cant use any of the fiber companies aa my apartment isnt wired for it but it deflates my prices atleast.I also dont mind to much even if they did because I do most of my downloading at my school that has a 13.8 Gbps connection.\n',

Whats worth more is the damning publicity, the more people that hear about these practices the harder it hurts them.\nFakeWalterHenry: What are the people that hear these damning things going to do? Switch to a different ISP?\nGutenbergbible: That fine of $2.3 million is for systematically overcharging customers for services they never wanted and never asked for over the last two years. In 2014 and 2015, they posted a profit of $16,543,000,000.Thats a hundredth of a percent to them. Thats a one penny fine on a hundred dollar crime. While thats the biggest cable fine the FCC has ever imposed, its a drop in the bucket compared to the profit they make with shady billing practices.While Comcast agreed to more stringent policies alerting customers to changes and getting consent, they blamed the issue on isolated errors and customer confusion. So, immediately after paying a multi-million dollar fine for overcharging and misleading customers, they issued a statement blaming their customers for it. Welcome to Comcast Country.\n69imbatman: thats a one penny fine on a $10,000 crime \nSeeeab: Im sure that will teach them to take advantage of their consumers and theyll never do it again! :)\nwrgrant: Yeah, that is the problem with the fines that get charged to mega-corporations like this. The fine should have an impact. This is probably less than the amount paid as a bonus to 1 senior executive.If they had made it a $2.3 Billion dollar fine, Comcast and its competitors would sit up and take some notice, but this means nothing.\n31415927: \n',

 'desc': u'ItsMeCaptainMurphy: What a garbage article.First off, its comparing live TV audience to live  youtube views. Not unique users, but views. So anyone who went back to watch another segment later counts again. Most articles/blogs probably link to youtube clips of the debate because thats just easier. And if you click through to the actual youtube blog, youll find that their peak concurrent live viewership was only 1.5M people. Which lends credit to the theory that a lot of those views might not have been people watching the debates live, thus invalidating the comparison.Second, nowhere does it appear to control for only US viewership (the youtube blog confirms these numbers were worldwide). Seems unlikely the US presidential debate was broadcast on television in many countries outside of the US. So for anyone abroad/foreign youtube would be the most likely place to go to watch it if they were interested.\nmorecomplete: ...but, but, it STOMPED TV! Stomped I tells ya! \ndatarancher: Ancedata, I know, but a lot of people in Canada watched the debate, almost entirely though youtube. \nmaxk1236: Im in the US,  and everyone I know who watched it used YouTube, but that may be skewed because college age people are more likely to have cut the cord to begin with. The same problem is gonna happen with reddit because of the demographics here. Its a show of a change in times regardless I suppose, streaming services seem to be where the industry is heading,  lets hope that the content providers wise up and dont try to make everything exclusive to their streaming service, otherwise pirating will still have the edge. \nrockocanuck: Yup. Glorious way to spend thanksgiving. Enjoying the shit show that was that debate. \nvlasvilneous: Son, there is only one Thanksgiving and it happens on a thurday\nismokeforfun2: When is this Thurday\nG65434-2: GET REKT TV NOOB!\nBoBoZoBo: HOW DARE YOU question and expose the digital media train\nfiveamtuesday: apparently Iran broadcast it as well as discussed it on television.\ncentrals: You the MVP. Thanks\ndefrgthzjukiloaqsw: Oh, it was definitely broadcast live on TV in germany and denmark, so im sure that also happened in lots of other places. The viewers of those are obviously not counted in the 63 million number.I still prefer to watch it on Youtube because both german and danish TV broadcast only the soundtrack with live interpretation on my particular TV provider.\nShiroi_Kage: Well, then add whatever TV service for people to rewatch.Views are what matter, not unique viewers. When you view the same show twice on TV, that counts. When you view the same episode multiple times to go through all of it, that counts too.\nCinemaphreak: What a complete  Those on-demand videos are mostly  the complete debate, but edited snippets. You know, what most of YouTube is made of. If you are going to count that crap for YouTube, then you need to include the viewership for every single show that has showed clips of the debate discussing it.  and all the network news programs that covered it all day Monday. Im guessing that total would put TV easily back on top. \najcunningham55: Im sure more people viewed more adds through youtubes stream & videos than they did through the TV broadcast\najcunningham55: Im sure more people viewed more adds through youtubes stream & videos than they did through the TV broadcast\nBezeltazer: Dont care. Makes cable companies shit themselves harder as their most consistent viewer base literally dies off year over year.\nIpMedia: Yeah, ok, just to sprinkle some reality into what you just said the cable companies (who knew this includes C-SPAN!) are much more aware of the numbers and the way things work a la what OP just described than you do because its literally their job to know all of this and the difference between core product and medium/platform. I appreciate the circlejerk but you dont have to be dumb about it. \nBezeltazer: I appreciate the condescension but cable is bad mmk.\nIpMedia: I wasnt trying to be condescending but do understand thats how it came off, though your comment was unfortunately a really naive and incorrect one as well so I couldnt really emphasize my point without pointing out your logical errors... things arent that simple or black and white.  Case in point most shows on Netflix (including their originals) are made partly or wholly by and in many ways thanks to, what a lot of people on reddit just couple in as, cable in the US or other countries.So that umbrella term doesnt really make sense anymore.\nbacktotheocean: It is unfortunate that they are also internet providers and pushing for control of the new medium. \nCAPTAIN_JAMES_T_JERK: I have enjoyed watching the debates unadulterated on YouTube in Hidef.  Its too bad the content is garbage in, so we gonna get garbage out.\nrem1473: Youre right that its an apples to oranges comparison.Too lazy to read the article, but if each click results in YouTube delivering an ad to the clickee, then that is a very significant number nonetheless.\nDavidjhyatt: The most convenient way to watch was also free. \noversized_hoodie: The Washington Post had a livestream on YouTube without any commentary (or they did for the first debate, I havent watched the second one yet). That alone would make me choose YouTube over TV, even if it was harder to watch than on tv. \nVrashnar: Youtube watcher here. Really enjoyed watching it on Youtube, it loaded quickly, was good quality and easily accessible on my tv/computer/phone. I actually did watch on all 3 devices as the night progressed. I also enjoyed that it was free, but honestly would have chipped in 50c to $1 if that was the model. Most important was the accessibility & ease of use. I did enjoy that there werent any ads.\nStumpynuts: This is no different than saying there are more people that have listened to a bands record-setting album than the number of people who were in the studio when it was first being recorded.More shocking information... Justin Bieber has more youtube views for his latest hit single than the number of people who first heard the same song on SNL. AMAZING.\nAxel1010: And the comments section was an aweful collection of penises and nazi svastikas.\ntritonx: What is this TV they talk about?\nNarcissisticDramaQwn: I know I watched it on YouTube because I also wanted to watch the Packers play... \nrlp6028: The 5 second commercials gave viewers a reprieve from listening to them \ntemporarycreature: I watched the PBS broadcast on Youtube, and I didnt see commercials, either because there were none, or because of UBlock Origin.  \nAmphibialrabies69: If Im not mistaken I thought PBS didnt run ads as it was funded by the public. The only ads theyd have would be for their own programs. \ndonna-chang: PBS has ads, theyre just not usually the same ones you see on other networks, and they dont interrupt programs.\nAmphibialrabies69: Gotcha. Its been over 12 years since I watched that channel so I wasnt sure what it was like, just going off memory. \ntemporarycreature: Yeah, I think so, I have no idea because I dont have cable, or a way to use my TV for anything, but Netflix, and other apps. \n__jamil__: The Public Broadcast System (PBS) is not a cable channel\ntemporarycreature: I dont have a way to watch it, still.

Id constantly rob banks. \n2th: Which is ridiculous. The customers are paying Comcasts fine. There is no incentive for Comcast to stop their shady practices.\nCrazyKiller5150: Sad but true.

They wont even blink.\nPessimiStick: Its actually more like getting a $10 fine with a $500 early payment refund.  They made  more than 2.3 million overcharging people.\nPlayer--1: What the hell is $2mil gonna do?

Look at the Note 7 for example.  Its low failure rate is unacceptably high when multiplied by millions of devices.  It was canned.In any modern electronic device there are  of transistors.  Each has a failure rate that is so low - in the 1/trillions, that the entire device rarely fails.Systems that fail get fixed until they ultimately almost never fail.If overcoming technology failures was as impossible as this article indicates, the world we live in would not exist.\nvadergeek: Well, sure, if youre measuring by length of time and not amount actually done. Which is a terrible idea. \nbombula: The article itself is more interesting than this headline. Human-machine interactions are a complex business, especially in high-stakes situations like piloting vehicles. At the beginning of a technologys evolution, when its usefulness is high but its error rates are still significant, it can be a real challenge to figure out how best to structure the human-machine relationship. But over time this question tends to resolve itself as technology improves and machine error rates drop to insignificance.Were in the middle of the roughest period of that transition for some key technologies right now (autopilot being the obvious example). That has folks like the author of this article in a lather, but its nothing new. Useful technologies can still a bit dangerous in their infancy. And then after a while theyre not.\nPM_ME_UR_Definitions: I commented about this article here: But wanted to comment on this specific quote too:When were talking about a computer being a million times faster were usually talking about calculations per second or something, so intermediate steps, not final outcomes. For example, a computer driving a car isnt going to take a million times more turns or stop at a million times more intersections than a human.And for things like simple calculations, computers can do error correction and be slower but much more accurate. If a computer is 100,000 times faster and makes less errors, that seems like a good tradeoff, right?\nwrgrant: Time for one of my favourite quotes:And I cant for the life of me remember who said it :(\n',

I have to believe that they were trying to leak this stuff with plausible deniability. \ngilvoth: I wonder if this was a happy accident. I can imagine a disgruntled Samsung tech saying Seriously? Another one from the safe batch?

I jumped ship before they got a chance to cut my position (which was scheduled to be cut after 13 years)It sucked to leave (particularly the pay) but i dont miss all the red tape and I dont miss the hour commute or ridiculous chain of command.\ndnew: Oh, I understood. I was just trying to pun on the idea of a rifle scope.\nGreellx: why would they get negative press for firing an employee that accidentally leaked something designed to be an internal communication about a sensitive customer related subject? They wouldnt.\nLloydBentsen: Im not saying the negative press would be deserved.\nGreellx: Fair enough :) They probably have plenty of legal protection...as they have a legal right to terminate his employment if he attempts to go to the press, or attack the company....itll be the worst mistake he makes in his life (Other than fucking up and sending that text message that got him fired, I mean...)\nCatsAreGods: Theyre lucky they work in SOUTH Korea!\nredditwithafork: Why not?  Their phones are SO HOT!\nmerton1111: Thats definitely not a tech. Tech people are not in contact with customers. \nGreellx: I work in the wireless industry...I have met and interacted with MANY samsung reps...half the time (Or most of the time, in Samsungs case) the reps are 3rd party employees that are paid lower paid, have lower experience, and are lesser trained that report to a real Samsung employee (I say REAL samsung employee, because they are often the people that have far more knowledge and power than the generic rep wearing the shirt with the brand) ...I imagine that this interaction, since it was done over text message (and not email) was one of those such reps trying to communicate with their boss to clear the situation---and they screwed up, because they handled sensitive information improperly (probably lost their job for the PR nightmare too)If anyone thinks that EVERY major company isnt exactly like this internally (trying to silence the problem-customers to avoid a PR nightmare) ...youre naive. The only difference between every other company and Samsung, is that Samsungs sludge spilled into the public eye.\nwafflesareforever: Exactly my point. \nlosian: I like that sending a text message apparently qualifies as stop from going to the press. Like, the guy would start and then hed glance at his phone and recoil.Companies are shit. Priority 1 is damage control and avoid lawsuits/settlements. If anyone thinks otherwise you are a new level of naive to say the least.The text message is astronomically far from shocking - its the polar opposite.. and that fact alone should horrify us.\nStiltonrocks: True, every other phone manufacturer when their phones assplode, even after being fixed, try to stall people that have nearly died because of said fixed phone.True.\nBipolarGod: \nJonathan924: You need a second line break there to make it stop quoting \nLloydBentsen: \nDogBoneSalesman: I feel like Samsung knows exactly whats going on but is too afraid of the fallout to admit it. \nJorgTheElder: That would be odd, once they did a recall, it would be cheaper to just bite the bullet. Having to do a second recall is really going to cost them.I wish the GearVR worked with some other large screen phone. No one else had added the low level VR support hooks that Oculus (and J. Carmack) worked with them to get. I would love a Motorola Pure if did VR at the same level of GearVR.\nBiebs53: Sadly yet understandably, GearVR no longer works with the Note 7.  Now you get a warning saying its not allowed. \nJorgTheElder: Really? CRAP! My phone lease is up in November, they better figure it out by then... The S7 just seems too small!\ndnew: How about the Pixel? Probably not with Oculus, but its clear people are moving in that direction.\nJorgTheElder: Yea, Goolgle has promised low level optimizations in both the Android and the Pixel phones, but I dont know  that will be generally available and supported by devs.Just to be clear, I do not care about Samsung or VR in general, I just want Minecraft VR on a mobile device.\ncrest123: GearVR does work with all the other recent samsung flagships that does not explode.\nJorgTheElder: Thanks!Does any one have suggestions of G7 vs G7E when GearVR is concerned?\ncrest123: G7E has a larger screen and has a bigger battery. Other than that, not much.\nJorgTheElder: No, they accidently sent a text to the user that was meant for a coworker. The message was asking, and I am paraphrasing here, He is threatening to sue, should try and appease him or just let him go ahead?Nowhere did the text message saying anything about the press. He contacted Samsung and threatened to sue them, as you would if you phone tried to kill you, :), and they were discussing how to proceed.\niOSecure: The way you paraphrase it changes the tone significantly......Actual message:\nJorgTheElder: I disagree, it does not change the tone at all.  I can try and slow him down is only threating if you purposefully ignore the facts.If you followed the story, you already know the context is that HE contacted THEM, and threatened to sue. The threat was about suing, not going to the press.\ndocmedic: The tone was changed.is dismissive of the severity of the issue to the customer.acknowledges the issue for what it is to the customer.  Customer wants to be appeased, not slowed down.  Samsung publicly wants to make things right for the customer, and there is no dissonance with intent had they said appease instead of slowing down.So yeah, ultimately its bad press.  Every company claims to have the interests of the customer at heart.  Some do, some dont.  The ones that get outed suffer some level of bad press.  The ones that get outed after failing the customer twice REALLY suffer for it.\nNorthernerWuwu: Yeah, internal dialogue isnt always pretty though. Ive discussed clients in a  more negative way but that doesnt mean I dont care about them or their problems. Its just how customer-facing agencies operate when the client isnt in the room.\nCUTTHROATAMFT: The Trump campaign needs you right now.\nJorgTheElder: Yea, it is certainly bad press. But then again, it was an accident. Happy accidents are few and far between. :)\nTheappunderground: You definitely completely changed the tone from malicious and conspiratorial to eh whatever itll be ok. \nLachiko: You introduced malice and conspiracy with your own biases.\nJorgTheElder: I changed the meaning because I added the missing context.If only sounds malicious because everyone wants to believe that they were discussing threatening the guy to keep him from going to the press.\n(1 child): \nJorgTheElder: Really?I think you need to either get back on your meds or take less of them. \nLoud_Stick: No where did the text say stop him from suing \nahchx: looks like the Galaxy brand will be rename to BigBang.\nSporadic_Won: Thats a classic oh fuck kind of moment. I should probably return my note7 one of these days\nwee_knee: Oh, thats just crazy talk. When has a mega-corporation ever tried to hide problematic retail goods theyre selling?You sound like one of those conspiracy fellas.\nmy_hunt: With money?\nS3PANG: Wonder how many more 0s they added to the settlement with that oops.\nbadf1nger: What? Ive never heard of such a thing! You mean to tell me that a business would want to handle issues like that internally?

 'desc': u'ADrunkMonk: Seeing how I only ever got Yahoo email as spam and fantasy football updates....they can keep those.\nAlmostTheNewestDad: Reduce features. Thatll make em loyal! \nrykh7: Sounds like its straight from Apples playbook.\nPickitPackitSmackit: Aww, a couple fangrrls didnt like your nugget of truth.\nbhtitalforces: Do they still let new users pick email addresses from deleted accounts?\ndodland: I would hope not just for the sake of security and privacy. Otherwise yeah thatd be rad. \nbhtitalforces: I have to babysit my shitty yahoo email account because I dont want it deleted and have some shit in the future get emails that were addressed to my old email account.\nAlwaysWolves: under development? If Yahoos still trying to figure out how to implement straight-up RFC821 shit theyve got a hard row to hoe.\ndnew: Especially since it was working fine until they turned it off. Its not like this is a new feature.\nAbnormal_Armadillo: The article says its temporary, and anyone who already has forwarding enabled is not affected.People like to shit on Yahoo users, but seem to forget that there was a time where Gmail didnt exist, which obviously means they signed up for Yahoo or other services. Migrating everything youve signed up on to another email isnt a fun thing to do, you have to sign into each account and change the information, sometimes having to answer security questions to do so.I want to totally migrate away from it, changing my email on accounts that I remember (IE: Steam, Dropbox, Netflix, Amazon, Tumblr, ect.), but its incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to remember all of the websites Ive signed up with using my old email address (some of which I may, or may not, still care about.)Pretty much every website ties your email address to it, and most people arent very good with using their computers. Id imagine that many didnt even know forwarding was possible, or that they can change the emails they signed up with on other websites. As for me, I set things to be forwarded from my old address while I figure out whats still registered under that address and if I even care about it. Ive gotten spam on my account before, but not hundreds of emails like everyone imagines.\nInternetUser007: Yahoo also said this: This feature is under development.Thats crap. Its not under development, they took it away. Email services have had forwarding for years. This is a blatant removal of features in order to try and keep as many users as possible until the Verizon takeover is finished.\nMarkKB: If that were their goal, then it doesnt make sense to . I mean, that makes it  to leave, especially if you have a lot of emails to transfer.\nBinsky89: Its stupid easy to setup email forwarding.For example, . Now, yahoos services are probably a tad bit more complicated (databases and stuff), but theyre full of shit.\nGaryNevillesValencia: Also if youre now leaving Yahoo for privacy reasons then of all mail services Googles is probably among the last you should pick.\nAbnormal_Armadillo: If someone cares about privacy to that extent they need to learn how to host their own service. It obviously isnt for everyone (me included), but Id prefer if my data didnt get leaked once a year with Google. Ive seen Yahoo get jacked up too many times, but thats why I put 2-factor authentication on everything.\nVauxlient: Youll want to go somewhere like \nAraziah: Ive had quite a few email addresses over the years. I used to maintain a list of all the places I had created accounts. I dont any more. Because if I havent used them recently enough to remember about them, they dont matter to me. If its something like a store that has my credit card information, and its older than 2 years or so, the credit card is probably expired anyway.So I have a handful of accounts that I use. Every so often, Ill run through them and do a password reset. If I dont remember about the account, it really doesnt matter.\nThaliur: I switched to Outlook.com exclusively and it was  easy. You just enter your account data (IMAP or POP3) for your old account, and the System will copy all your existing mails (including Folder structure). After that, whenever mail arrives on your old account, it will be fetched by your new one. You can even send as your old account if your want to.\nAbnormal_Armadillo: Basically the same as forwarding, and Im fairly certain you need to have a premium yahoo account for those features because theyre assholes.Migrating means youre logging into your accounts and changing your info so it goes directly to your new email, instead of doing something like Yahoo>Google\nsrob101: I dont know, POP3 stopped working for me about 11 days ago.\nLeiryn: If you havent realized in almost 15 years since Gmail came into being that yahoo sucks and you need to get rid of it then sucks to be you.Also, why temporarily disable a feature that literally every email service has (hell I can forward emails through my domain without having an email service). \nAbnormal_Armadillo: Once people get set up with a service they generally stick with it unless it becomes unbearable to use. Some people have a higher threshold for that shit, especially older people. I cant even get my parents to enable 2 factor authentication on their accounts.For a long time I didnt care about what my email was as long as I could log into the accounts I needed to get to, but with several security breaches I started my migration. Being a dickhead about it serves no other purpose than to continue the circlejerk of lol Yahoo users.\nMarkKB: In addition,  says that if you have forwarding disabled, POP access will be enabled (and vice versa), so the titles misleading even if it was disabled for everyone.\nrawWwRrr: Still have yahoo account. Did it the old fashion way years ago but moved all my contact information away to a Gmail account. Now I just check it in case there was something I missed that might be important. Other than that, Id drop it altogether. \nWaterrat: Been forwarding for several months.\nI drew a line in the sand the other day and my Yahoo email account will be gone next month. \nSniperGX1: Google would do the same thing if/when they get to the point of bleeding users.  The best thing to do for email is to move to an email address at a domain you control.  You can still use google if you like, but its easier to leave when you want to.\nRpgwaiter: I really dont think this will be commonplace. This will cause Yahoo to lose a lot of its customers. \nkickerofbottoms: That requires paying $10/mo, though. Not saying its not worth it, but most people arent gonna do that\ndnew: More like $10/year.\nmaharito: Ill do it if it means they pay people to patrol Youtube and stop using bots.\nnoonenone: One slimy underhanded move after another. Oh the shame of it.\nthehunter699: Who the fuck actually has a yahoo account these days?!?\nsurgesilk: someone who had one when they were the biggest and arguably the best 12+ years ago\nabacusreiki: How dare a free service not offer you what you want.\nPickitPackitSmackit: I would figure a person subbed to  wouldnt be so obtuse. This must be a default sub now.\nM0b1u5: Well, if you were stupid enough to use Yahoo for email, then you probably deserve whatever shit you are eating now.\nmasterchifchaf: Except for the fact that Yahoo is a pretty good email client, on par with Gmail up until now\nPickitPackitSmackit: Yahoo mail has never been on par with Gmail.\n2sport: Someone needs to grab Marissa Mayer by the pussy.\nmy_hunt: And hear that creepy laugh?  No thanks\n',

 'desc': u'spurioushamster: Thats not like the chinese to steal technology and hard earned research...\nWarbags: You know what, if the Chinese are going to steal something, at least it was a hydro power plant schematic rather than like a coal power plant schematic.  Environmentally conscious theft >= regular theft...I think?  \nadmronoc: Except instead of investing in the technology in 2011 they stole it and have essentially failed to bring a product to market. So now you have the innovative and underfunded team out of work and the talentless hacks who cant solve the final problems stumbling in the dark. Really that potential theft could worry many companies about the costs or risks of theft of doing more competitive research. \nBburrito: Number one reason my company wont go there is theft of technology.  They need help and we have a product that could help them right now.  Except we know that if we bring it over there they will just steal it. \nphosen: Thank you for your information, the Chinese premier will be sending information regarding his visit. Regards, The Great Firewall.\nSir__Hippo: Depends if youre viewing from the evil or moral angle. Unqualified comparators get people into trouble.Pedophiles >= RapistsPudding: See below\nMyNameIsDon: Is a pedophile, in the strictest definition, someone who commits acts? If its someone who gets turned on by kids and doesnt  do anything about it, I think its logical to say pedos>=rapists. They can be equal to rapists, but also sometimes better than.\ncccviper653: Wouldnt a pedophile that goes to the extreme then be moved to the child molester category? If so then pedos>rapists.\nMyNameIsDon: Isnt a child molester also a rapist?\n(3 children): \nhazysummersky: Thank you for your comment! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):If you have any questions, please  and include the link to the submission. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n(1 child): \nhazysummersky: Thank you for your comment! Unfortunately, it has been removed for the following reason(s):If you have any questions, please  and include the link to the submission. We apologize for the inconvenience.\nBipolarGod: I think you dropped the /s\nRegayov: It got /tolen \nUpHandsome: I dont think he was being /serious. \nSir__Hippo: Thats not what /s means...\nrare_pig: /sure\nBulletBilll: Lol you fell for the gag! /s has always meant /serious. Use /ss for super serious. /s\nUltimaniacx4: Not sure if youre getting downvoted because spurioushamster was so obvious, or if people actually think they were being genuine.\nKeinichn: In my network security groups and research, were taught that you can roughly point out where an attacker is from based solely on the type of attack.Attackers from Russia, Ukraine, etc, like the money. Theyre usually the ones that push out ransomware, phishing attacks, fund wiring, etc.Attackers from China like trade secrets and are usually sponsored by a Chinese company. Theyll get into your network, copy up all your blueprints, specifications, guides, etc, and then duplicate it as a Chinese knock-off. They especially target foreign companies looking to either get into the Chinese market or handle the manufacturing.For example, one of our clients acquired another company a while back. It was a company that had some ties to a Chinese company. After we got everything from the prior company integrated, we got an email from a trustworthy rep at the bought out company saying our accountant from China needs to access for tax purposes. My response to my client was a nice form of hell no and we (nor them) ever heard a word about it past that.\nmellowmarcos: our government conducts industrial espionage just like Russia and China. Its a constant game of cat and mouse.  \nreal_ak: I think were simply on the right side of the innovative curve in a lot of areas.\nmellowmarcos: Sure, no argument about that. \nreal_ak: Do you have any articles that complement your above point? I havent really heard much about industrial espionage being performed by the US.\nJunistry2344567: You dont hear it because the western MSM wont report on it.\nBlazicus: To be fair, the only reason the US had an industrial revolution was because of this very same thing.\njdtran408: Scots and chinese are now natural enemies. Like englishmen and scots. Or welshmen and scots. Or japanese and scots. Or scots and other scots. \ndWintermut3: The history of Scotland is one of a long and bitter conflict with their worst enemy- the scots.\nSatanakanataS: In order to face his equal, a Scot is forced to engage in battle with Scots. \nphx-au: In the traditional Scottish combat style: Broken bottles on the main street of Glasgow.\nLeicaM6guy: What, no highland charge?\nWaxdec: You scots sure are a contentious people.\nCarbsv2: Youve made an enemy for life!\nSerious_Guy_: Damned Scots, they ruined Scotland!\nElTuco: In Marc Goodmans book Future Crimes he discusses the largest transfer of Human wealth to ever occur.If you want to get some insight into what to expect in the coming years, I suggest you read it.Through Chinas hacking efforts they have stolen Trillions of Dollars of US Tax Payer money that has gone into research and development of anything the Government has done including all those new fighters etc.They have also attacked US Industry and have basically stolen every recipe for Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, etc. Decades of R&D and 100s of millions of dollars gone.Another of their many thefts was Chinese State Owned Sinovel Wind Group stole AMSCs computer code that was developed to run power generating Wind Mills. It cost the company almost a 1 billion dollars a year in lost revenue and all the money it took to develop it.China is a Nation of Thieves.Here is an article about the theft of F35 TechThe worst thing a company can do is cooperate with these people. They will stop at nothing to steal everything you have.\nJustifiedAncient: This is why Im thrilled my spineless govt (UK) has just embarked on the huge folly of letting them build the next generation of our nuclear power stations. This will obviously end well.Edit. Well, it appears the Chinese are downvoting me, they really are very thorough!\nSeen_Unseen: Well we also help them in their own playing field. China is a vast market so you dont want to miss out on it. China simply stipulates that if you want to take part of it, you must enter in a JV and over time they demand more and more to be manufactured in China itself. Thus basically handing over the IP for doing so.The finance industry, same story. So they consider it a vital industry and only allow to play foreign companies in 0,5% of their insurance market by doing so they know how they operate and learn from it.We as a foreign enterprise have a collocation and are demanded by the local authorities to place one of their own load balancers in between. It works though not knowing whats in that box you can pretty much guarantee that it taps into our traffic and possibly further. But if you refuse, they pull your online license. Even while we have no local domain, we cant live without an IT infrastructure which requires we have this license.I can keep going on about the stories here, some simply sound as if they were pulled straight out of a Bond movie. Corporate espionage is a big thing, but not only corporate. They want to know every single movement you make.\nsamsc2: there is nothing americans can sell in china. Every single foreign product that even attempts to sell there is generally met with vast rip offs and fakes which drastically overshadow it. They will have a domestic version of w/e even before you get your real product to their market. There is no money to be made there because its all controlled by the government or criminals which most of the time are the same damn thing. Most of the real stories about what they have done to our economy dont even see the light of day because of the vast vast vast hacking/trolling/shill groups that scan almost all news/media/social sites for anything that may be slightly negative about them to either downvote it or change the subject about it.\nSeen_Unseen: This is pure nonsensical and playing in mostly in someones emotions. There are a ton of foreign companies operating in the China, and while most find out the market on itself isnt easy this isnt mostly caused by ripoffs. The best recent example might be Apple who loses massive marketshare, while you are right initially on cheap knockoffs, these days Chinese mobile companies like ZTE/Xiaomi are simply superior to the foreign companies by providing mobiles at low prices yet not underdoing for performance.While you are right, knock offs are an issue this isnt so much institutionalized by the government opposed to fields that Beijing does see as vital. Consider the automobile industry, finance, engineering, energy are either impossible to get in or you get a tiny sliver handed and thats it. For worse take Siemens 13 years ago proudly announcing their first railway project in China, it was the only one and future projects are done 100% through Chinese companies. (Also actually the possible reason why there was a serious train accident a while ago due to copying but not understanding the inner mechanics of what they do).China is acting more and more hostile towards foreign companies by either introducing asymatric supervision of regulations, slow in procedures, creating impossible procedures specifically designed for foreign entities as well outright fake bidding processes to screw over foreign companies. But then again, when doing business in China and plenty of companies like P&G are doing this for decades, they know whats happening. But at the same time China is a market which is hard to ignore its size and more importantly its potential is beyond anywhere else in the world.\npremium_rusks: China the big boogeyman whoa. Check out the more level headed reply below. What theyre doing is no different from any other modern country, youre just on the other side of the propaganda. \nJunistry2344567: Wasnt there an article about a US airforce base being the most addicted city to reddit ;)\nCodebender: Not gone, its still valuable, just not a competitive advantage against China.Pretty much everything is more difficult and expensive to develop than it is to reverse-engineer.  If youre shipping a product to the public, you cant keep it a secret.For military stuff, states spend decades getting agents into positions of trust in foreign powers to get those secrets, so a hack is just a shortcut, they would have gotten it eventually.  And dont imagine that China is the only country doing this kind of thing.  The U.S. spies on everyone, friend or foe.  Israel has been caught stealing military secrets from the U.S. on several occasions, and even stole enriched uranium at one point.  And if any country were spending enough money on their military to outdo U.S. R&D, the U.S. would be doing everything they could to steal it.\npeacebuster: This reminds me of a strategy computer game, where players can choose to invest their points in R&D, or invest in spying in order to steal R&D skills from their opponents. I dont remember the name of the game though.\nle1ca: Civ V?\nhang_them_high: Master of Orion 2?\nuep: This was my thought. The Chinese are Darlocks?\nallthenamesaretaken0: Ruthless? I loved that game but no one remembers it.\nTuckersMyDog: Nice try Chinese propaganda slinger\nJunistry2344567: \nattendingsleep: Theres some racist thoughts being passed here. People shouldnt forget that China is a massive country which doesnt have a single hive mind. Even if this were government lead, we should remember there are good and honest Chinese people. News reports where someone/government-arm in your own country does something you believe is not at all reflective of your own behavior isnt uncommon....\nJunistry2344567: Hmm looks like someone has forgotten the US used to steal British patents to jumpstart their own industrial revolution. Also the US government still does the same thing today.\nblumpkin_connoisseur: Or like the English stealing tea from China.\nNeverBob: If hacking and information theft are the future of war, as opposed to stealing land and resources via bombardment and occupation, I suppose well just have to adapt.\nSmack-Down: Consider it damages repayment for the century of molestation and humiliation the west imposed on China, in which US was involved. \nmeneye: What the hell are you talking about? The research? Or are you saying they have literally stolen this amount of money?\nOrleanian: Hes implying that the stolen technology puts them even with the US without having to have paid trillions of dollars to get there.\nmeneye: Thats not the same thing as actually stealing the money from the US. Its not like they would have paid that amount to the US if they hadnt stolen the tech. Its the same false equivalency as the MPAA uses in reference to pirates. \nPatternWolf: Im seeing a trend here. Ive heard of a similar story where a windmill company offshored some of the work to china. They suddenly found a competing company with very similary technology to there own.\nBburrito: Same thing happened to the Japenese company who made the bullet trains.  Partnered with a Chinese company to build the trains... partner stole the plans and just built them themselves.  \nuep: This is actually why the US needs strong IP laws. China will continue to do this. They have no regard for intellectual property at all.\ntheemprah: its, why if you ever do walk throughs like this. never show anyone exactly where you store things, and alter the setup, hell put up fake work terminals, so when they plug in there backdoor USBs it ends up doing nothing, as the computers are just for show. \nTheKrud: Its why you should NEVER invest in Chinese exports for your IT infrastructure.  See that hub there?  That firewall?  That router?  That mobile phone?  Your shits heading straight to Ying Tong Industries.  Screw you, Ying Tong.  Screw you and your baffling sex education practices that still hurts my arse after 40 years.\nJunistry2344567: Same goes for US IT exports. Unless you want Five Eyes in your network dont buy US made electronic products.\naskjacob: so use wood for everything. Got it.\nJunistry2344567: Actually that is a very good advice for IT security. The Kremlin switched back to typewriters to put a stop to leaks via cyberattacks. My point is, all electronic devices are subject to cyberattacks. If you want to keep secrets, either dont physically connect them to the internet or dont even use computers in the first place (which is near impossible).\nzombie_toddler: Heres an idea: how about investing in some actual PHYSICAL SECURITY, like alarms, cameras and a few security guards?Idiots left the entire building empty at night? Thats what they get.\nm0wax: Furthermore.  Encrypt data while at rest.  All modern OSs have this ability.\ntheemprah: well, basic physical security, like placing all work laptops in secured rooms/areas would be more realistic. Also keeping all the computers on a closed network not connected to the internet\nKalzenith: This is what their education system teaches their citizens. Success at all costs because mediocrity = shame. If youre not cheating, youre not trying hard enough, and your parents will disown you.Fucking despicable.\naskjacob: its not really seen as cheating, it is using every means available to you. I dont condone it, it is just a skewed perspective, and a huge culture shift\nKonW: could you so kindly give me some citations or solid proof for your statement rather than pure speculations?there are fraud and cheat in every country and anywhere ppl will want to win and advance, espionage and survailance is rampant in any country as well, so wheres your source, please?\nKalzenith: Here let me Google that for youCombine this with their need to keep an honourable face to the public, their highly competitive job market, and merit based single party government, and you have an atmosphere that breeds corruption.\nKonW: you listed only once source of a little blog about one student copying from others while writing papers, this kind of things are common in any countries even the most prestigious ones, the most recent Haruko Obokata scandal are papers on major journal like Nature, you maybe never head of it in your line of work or alternative world or whatever stone your udner, but this is a world news level event, not even to mention the countless ones from USA Korea, etc, when there are many ppl, a low percentage number gets bigger as youd expect,  considering the number of chinese ppl and this is one nameless paper on a small journal i dont see how this could stand out compared to the STAP cell paper fraud?and how this one example can be considered proof or source to your statement, or do you mean there simply arent any of this in the USA(consdiering how ignorant you are, this might be the case) or do you have proof and solid percentage and numbers, or that published fraud papers influences index are higher in thoese from the chinese?or are you just simpley shouting out of racism? in which case, pls dont ming giving me another reply.your other 3 resources are merely repeating the same thing. I have to doubt do you really have any solid source or are just wasting my time.\nKalzenith: Did you happen to overlook the peer reviewed papers? If youre unconvinced by the study done by others, I recommend you write your own research paper.\ngw2re: you are despicable\ntracknumberseven: No, your countrys practices are.\nminchuu: I remember reading somewhere that when the Chinese came over to fit the Goliath crane Babcock bought for the carrier build at Roysth dockyard, our security services reckoned at least a third of the Chinese workers would be intelligence operatives.Whether its true or not, it doesnt sound unlikely.\nzero_td: They already stole all our housing \nhiyosilver64: Mysterious? Raises suspicions? NO WAY!!\nmonstrol: The Chinese stole something??!!.....I am shocked!\nindoobitably: whoa, chinese people stealing from others and still producing an inferior product?  who would have thought...\nearlsmouton: Reminds me of this article from 2015;\nThrowMeAwayBBY69: Dirty fucking Chinese, always copying, stealing and shitting on streets. God damn dishonest culture with cheating and theft. What the fuck is wrong with them, cant they just be fucking innovative themselves instead of hacking everyone and stealing ideas like some pathetic fucking losers. \nIsabellaJacob0074: Thought China was your new best ever trading partner???\nSpeaktomenow: This.\nMoholmarn: \nCanisMaximus: Seriously, fuck the Chinese. Even other Chinese dont like the Chinese.\nraudssus: If they would also steal the working quality of other countries, then.... THEN we should be scared.... (Working with a china factory indirectly, those are the most stupid people I ever talked with, I rephrase my sentences 5 times before sending out, just to be sure to avoid ANY alternative interpretation of what I said)\nnak3rbott: The Chinese stealing tech from the Celts again? Blimey!\nthirteenth_king: Cheating China.\nMatrixManAtYrService: It looks like Im outnumbered here, but this strikes me as a good thing that happened. Pity they had to steal a bunch of laptops to get it done though.If the Chinese company were a competitor of the Scots, then I think society ought to recognize who the innovators are and they should get preferential treatment some how. But since thats not the case, we should just be happy that theres a place like China where technologies that would have been unviable in the West due to our backwards intellectual property laws can have a second chance to flourish. \nlactozorg: You see, if they invested instead of replicating the technology, it could have been now a marketable product instead of a study in development.\n(2 children): \nhazysummersky: 6 years and you bother with this?\nhazysummersky: Thank you for your comment!

I wanted the Bulls to go after him to back up Rose\nqui-sean: Well he is backing up Rose\npablasso: Yes, thats why its weird.\nRickyRubiOops: He is going to start over Rose \nLoveMeSexyJesus: lol\nRickyRubiOops: Not only does Brandon Jennings run the point better he isnt a fucking rapist piece of shit.\nBirdunit: Well that escalated quickly. \nbbgun91: Hm.ok (>.)>\nDjangoUBlackBastard: Neither is Rose. Pay attention to the case.\nseniordan: ALLEGEDLY\nRickyRubiOops: Alleged rapist. Im sorry guys.\nEnoTaku: Read the new info that came up on the case before you judge prematurely about the outcome of the case. Rose is a fucking idiot - no doubt, but that doesnt mean hes a rapist. \nLoveMeSexyJesus: Wooooaaaah lets let the court case actually take place before we label someone a rapist.\nBasedGodProdigy: Wanted the Nets to snag him for a low priced 1 yr deal as well. Fun player to watch even though he can be bit of a chucker\nDirtyPoetry: I wanted the magic to grab him for Tobias Harris! Good thing we never went through with it\ndonttazemeBRA: There was a video clip during the game of him saying he sees himself as John Starks and Noah as Anthony Mason. They played it right after this happened, it was hilarious. \nJamesBrownAMA: we love these knucklehead types, for better or worse\nkubideh_kaczynski: hes not a rookie he was with the sixers a couple of years agoi thought it was hilarious though, wonder if they have some drew league history or something\njamills21: Probably lol. I would have thought they would be cool with each other but I guess Brandon knows how to get in Caspers head.  in the Drew League though. \nWalrusInMySheets: Lol Javale McGee and Nick Young getting that Wizards/Shaqtin reunion on.\njamills21: Gilbert Arenas plays on that team too sometimes. \nsomecallmemo: I actually grew up playing on a travel ball team with Casper and against him in high school multiple times a year. Jennings is from Compton and theyve been playing against each other since at least high school and like you said, the Drew. This is definitely just competition going way back \niamwizzerd: How did you fare against Casper back then?\nsomecallmemo: Fairly well since I knew how he played and Im a few inches taller. Hes one of the scrappiest and strongest guards I played against and Im sure many others would say the same. Hes a real good dude though, I hope he makes the roster \niamwizzerd: Can you tell what kind of players are NBA material when you play against them? Did you try to get into the NBA? Are you playing anywhere now?(sorry this is just so interesting)\nsomecallmemo: Well I was lucky enough to have a dad who was in the NBA and on the 1972 Olympic team so I was pretty good in high school but didnt go on passed that. I have played against about 10 NBA players in my past. Lets see..James harden, Klay Thompson, played with Landry Fields and his cousin Cameron Jones (Warriors preseason roster right now) on our high school team, DeMar DeRozan, Brandon Jennings, Austin Daye, Solomon Hill, Darius Morris is who I can think of now. To answer your question about knowing who would be in the NBA, guarding Harden, DeRozan, Jennings, and Klay I knew for a fact they were going to the league. James was a beast, DeMar is so athletically insane, he would put on shows during warm ups and the opposing team would end up watching him half the time while still trying to look focused and not appear to be in awe of the opponent. Klay dropped 40 in an all star game I was in while a junior and I knew this dude was the truth even though he got no love from colleges. Jennings was on a whole different level in high school, just go watch some highlights on YouTube, I think he has one of the best high school highlights of anyone but I may be slightly biased haha. Sorry for the long response and bad formatting, Im on mobile. \nEdit: I cant believe I could forget Kawhi too\njamills21: CIF Southern Section basketball really is the truth.\nsomecallmemo: It really is. Friends from other states always ask if I won state in high school and I say, no but Ive won 2 CIF titles and they laugh because they dont realize the Southern Section of CIF has more talent then their entire state usually. \njamills21: Yo, did you play against Jrue & Justin Holiday? Those were probably the best Highschool players I saw in person. Besides Renardo Sidney (lol smh) & Jordan Farmar when he won Los Angeles City Section player of the year.  \nsomecallmemo: I didnt play against them but my teammate was on their travel team. They had the most underrated talent on one travel team. Jeff Whithey, Justin and Jrue, PG and Klay. Hahaha funny you mention Sydney, that dude couldve been sooo damn good, I hated playing Artesia between him, Harden, and Malik Story\nceehouse: CIF Southern section man... I played during the class before you. Farmar, Nick Young, and Afflalo made it, and there were other prospects who were expected to go pro, but then it didnt pan out for whatever reason - Bryce Taylor (plays in Germany now I believe), Josh Shipp, Marcus Everett, Zach Woolridge, and the Wilkes bros (the younger one was just tall, the older one had some skill but never did much in college). the good ole days haha\nMAADcitykid: John wall has the best tape, but Jennings is right there behind him\nsomecallmemo: Yeah Wall was insane as well, thats why I said Im slightly bias cause I saw BJ play in person a number of times\nilladilla: Nice, so you played against DeMar too then?\nsomecallmemo: Yesssir. Played against him at Compton and also a little travel ball with Belmont Shores. Him vs high school kids just wasnt fair \nilladilla: Shit yeah, his junior mixtape looked like a man playing with boys lol\nsomecallmemo: He was so much better than everyone, during spring/summer league games that i saw a few of he wouldnt even warm up and just sit on the bench shooting the shit. Then, hed get up and throw down 2 or 3 dunks that you havent seen as a 16/17 year old kid and the whole gym would go crazy\n127crazie: Bringing back the SWAGGER to the Knicks. I like it\ntheo7777: Knicks in 6\neCharms: \nJonTDEOE: yooz a hoe\nihasroot: Small nit pick but he missed the free throw so it wasnt a four point play.\njonathanlaniado: Ha, true! I forgot about that, thanks. I guess its still better for brevitys sake.  as it is hahaha.\ncoug117: Also didnt look like a foul honestly\nTheGiantGlobEater: BALL DONT LIE\nanthdx: Good call Rasheed Wallace, starting power forward for the 2004 NBA Champions, Detroit Pistons.\nhennyandcheetos: It was a Jamal Crawford 4 point play \nCF4714: It wasnt, Jennings is just good at selling it, he did it a bunch for the Pistons. Similar to the leg kick after the shot players used to do.\nCharles__Martel: So in other words he got rewarded for flopping.\nZeppelanoid: He missed the free throw so he got no reward.\nSunsFan97: Still one of the most fun players in the league. I just love how he plays, his handles are fucking tight, just wish he never got that Achilles injury, he was balling for the Pistons.\nclown_pants: He was playing really good basketball when he got hurt too. It was such a disappointment when he went down\nfithworldruler: Motha fucka should have came to Arizona but money is money\nMrTape: brandon is on a 1yr 5million dollar deal \nmessejueller21: Hes referring to the University of Arizona- where BJ initially committed then decided to go pro in europe instead.\nMrTape: oh ok my bad\nOkgoahead23: I thought he went to the pros because he didnt have the grades to go to college\nthebaide: he needed to help his family. \nbxblox: Yeah look very entertaining so far. He has been linking up with kp on some nice plays.\nC-R-E-A-M-: bj looked deranged when he started clapping looool\nXZTALVENARNZEGOMSAYT: When the booty too real\nioPURAoi: \ndonttazemeBRA: ELI5 Jennings was supposed to get drafted by the knicks?\nlilcthecapedcod: 2009, we drafted jordan hill at 8th and jennings went to milwaukee on the 10th. Thats the only thing I guess\nSDF05: Literally threw some shade at the Knicks FO for not choosing him in the first place LOL. I really think they shouldve tho.\nJ27: you cant literally throw shade, thats impossible.\nTheArtofWall: Tell that to Boban Marjanovic.\nmilkgoggles: I mean, he was still being a complete asshole.\nGoochNibbler: This would be a lot cooler if it actually was an altercation instead of Jennings just being a dick. 100% of the aggression was coming from his end, the other dude was just kinda confused\nJGVjed: He didnt even guard Jennings first shot and still got shit on. lol\nlakerswiz: no indication if anything happened earlier in the game or if something was said.\nGoochNibbler: Fair point. Anyone who watched the whole game care to comment on this? Because without any context Jennings just looks like hes picking a fight for no real reason.\nShogun82: Im pretty sure it was for no real reason but then MSG showed an interview where jennings said him and joakim are gonna be a good duo bc theyre gonna be talking trash/antics the whole season so itll be pretty fun to watch from a knicks fan perspective\nchitownbulls92: After the game, he said it was something stemming from drew league times. So most likely they had beef before this\nioPURAoi: Hes not trying to pick a fight hes trying to get into the opposing players head. And he succeeded. He wants to bring toughness back to NY and he will probably do this all season. He did it to Isaiah Whitehead as well. \nGoochNibbler: He succeeded? Dude he was trying to intimidate didnt even react\nioPURAoi: He absolutely did. Jennings tried to go over the screen and bumped Ware. Then he took a few steps closer to him and Ware put his chest to Jennings. Which made the refs interfere with the play. Jennings is going to try to provoke any reaction from a player this year for a competitive advantage. You should know a thing or two about that being a wolves fan... \nElDiablo420: Him stepping up to Jennings after is not getting in his head lol? Thats a natural reaction, the dude didnt escalate or anything, and maintained his cool. \nioPURAoi: The problem here is nobody knows how Jennings has been playing all preseason and only see this one clip. Hes been in almost every players ear that hes been guarding. Trash talking on offense and defense. Nobody is getting into Jennings head hes just trying to have a mental advantage over his opponent. Watch the video again all the way till the end when its in slow motion you see all Jennings did was talk trash and Ware was talking back to Jennings. I was at the game they were going at it Jennings was just a bit more expressive about it. Which is why they both got double techs. \nchitownbulls92: Well it did get him to commit a silly foul on a 3 point shot\nGoochNibbler: Not much of a foul tbh\nchitownbulls92: It was the legs and not the arm \njrgraffix: the whistle sounded.\nBlazerBeav: Well if you cant play well, might as well be a clown.  Thank God I am not a Knicks fan.\nioPURAoi: Cant play well? Brandon averages 15/6 in the NBA yet you typing on a keyboard calling him a clown. Being a Knicks fan is completely irrelevant but ok...\nLAL8: Lmfao\neastbay_ak: Savage!\ndonttazemeBRA: it was from the drew league in the summer, watch the end of the interview\n\nORANG_DRAGIC: He looked like a crazy person when he was clapping. \nrahbee33: Wearing number 3 in New York can change you man. \nfischalish: Calderon will never be the same\n40Vert: Its a good thing they didnt sign A.I back when there was talks about it lol\nRudolphGobert: YEAAAAAAH BOY I just bumped into him and he totally didnt react!!!\nCornrow_Kenny: Lol. \noreoscar: This is my exp in NY. Held door open to a convenience store for some dude behind me, he just shoulder checks me walking past me like nothing happened.  Common courtesy aint a thing over there. \nNew-car-smell: Judge the entire 20 million people in the metro NY area off of one bad experience, thats sounds reasonable. \nHOU52k: Thats pretty well known NY behaviour\noreoscar: 4 experiences in one day actually. I was only visiting for two days. One of them was picking up some card a dude dropped from his at a mid town subway station.  Guy just looked at me annoyingly and took it, didnt even say anything.  Like bruh wtf.I was visiting friends in NY at Columbia. They agreed that its just a fast paced city and that was just the culture. Im just telling my experiences, buddy. \nFreeze__: Yeah, thats just what we do in NY lol\nPurple_9s: BULLY SEASON!\nSchleprok: Yeah I like Jennings but idk why he thought he got into caspers head. Just gotta find ways to psyche yourself up I guess. \nTornGauntlet: You are correct sir\n-Lemur: just like Joakim\ncorvenzo: Joakims actually made some sense b/c of his hostility against Lebron and the entire tension between the Bulls and Heat in that series. Im not really sure here what Jennings problem with that guy is. I mean, I like it still cause I love when players show emotion but just a tad confused\nImmynimmy: Man Noah always acted like he was the victim vs Lebron on the Cavs/Heat but really he was always the one starting shit.\nTorontoRapture: Or if it was an intense regular season or playoff game instead of a preseason. \nMAADcitykid: But this sub will eat it up and think Jennings came out ontop\nblaggityblerg: If anything, what the fuck is an old veteran backup PG getting hyped up after making a plain bucket during a pre-season game?edit: The second shot was sweet, though. Hes still getting a bit emotional for a vet. \ndonttazemeBRA: It was more a a smack talk situation going back to something that happened between them at the Drew league in the summer \nkingsfan34: I believe these guys have known each other for a while. Theyre both from Southern California and play in the Drew League every offseason. \ndonttazemeBRA: The Garden was lit last night for a pre season game!!!\nJC915: The Garden is a lot more fun when fans can afford to go\ndonttazemeBRA: its always fun\nJC915: I didnt say it wasnt. It just isnt always what it could be and the atmosphere gets subdued when Joe Schmo doesnt want to shell out that much money when the Lakers are in town.\nsalmon10: my fucking dude. Have a great season, BJ \nGriffinDMighty: Ron Baker looks so weird in a Knicks jersey. Dude seemed like hed be in college forever.\nbiggertuna4: Wow this is actually amazing. Its been a while since we had someone with this intensity,  Tyson Chandler maybe.  Him in Joakim will do wonders setting the tone every day. Its all about having the winning attitude\nStosstruppe: This crowd was so insane over this, Phil get a good team out there ASAP. Crowd would be as crazy as the ones in European Soccer.\nHaruSoul: Not that the Garden isnt usually a great place to enjoy a game, but with it being a preseason game tickets are actually a reasonable price (still expensive for preseason) so you have a chance to get some real fans in there.\npeanutbutter1236: I <3 Jennings \nninety4kid: I wish he was exciting in Orlando:/\nhouseQM: By the time he and Ersan got there, the damage was done. Not much they couldve changed honestly. \nAD3stacks: Man, I really miss Brandon. I knew the Tobias trade was the right basketball move for Detroit, but Ill never forget the way BJ was playing in the month or so before he tore his achilles. All-star caliber play and a vocal/emotional leader on the bench during a really fun win streak. Was kind of hoping wed try to steal him back when Reggie got diagnosed with his injury.\nJC915: People ITT getting way more upset about this than I thought they would.\nTyler_DLMG_14: I love Brandon so much. Jealous of the knicks\nCharles__Martel: Knick fans missed the antics of Reggie Miller so much they went out and got their own version.\nBluebillion: Take care of him\nConsumedAM: he dont want it lolno idea what that was about, but fun\nEthanhekker: I kinda feel bad for his defender because it seemed like Jennings really started that whole thing and kept going with it. He didnt even react when he got bumped lol. Dudes just trying to make the team and is getting yelled at by an instigator \nthe_great_brandini: i love brandon jennings to death\nksteph22: I miss him so much. Come back baby, we need you now more than ever.\nTorontoRapture: Only a knucklehead like Jennings would start shit during the preseason.\nNotNormal2: Such arrogant\nTonyD_BosS: I have a feeling Im gonna like this guy.\nMecha_Derp: Still my favorite player in the league \nBlaaa5: I <3 BJ \noOoleveloOo: Casper Ware is not a rookie\nHankscorpio17: Brenda Jennings face just pisses me off. \nes_80: savage.\nTheArtofWall: <Pistons fan.  I love jennings.  He plays with joy, like someone who loves the game.  He was great for us b4 that crappy injury.  Pistons fans not suppposed to ever root for Knicks, but i will will BJ on the court.\nSaucy_Totchie: Leave me alone, man.  Im just trying to get a job.\nLateGreat_MalikSealy: Id take Ware over Burke....\nbobojoe: I was a Jennings hater until I saw him playing in person for the Bucks.  Im not saying hes the greatest player in the world or anything, but he plays really hard and does not take plays off.  This game was against the Nets too, so you know its not like he was trying to put on a show that night.\nbystander-koko: Jennings is an idiot\nChris_Isur_Dude: I dont have a problem with Jennings but he is in the wrong here acting like a jerk\nmessejueller21: these dudes go way back.\njakaloaf: Am I supposed to be impressed or something? Brandon Jennings is trash talking a guy whos on a training camp deal and then clapping his hands after that like hes got in some superstars head... I think its just Brandon Jennings and maybe a few Knicks fans for now who think Brandon Jennings is still relevant.\njaeway: Lol its just a little competition, you never get turned up in the heat of a good battle?? \nserabia123: The preseason is his playoffs. \nToshing: I thought it was funny \nserabia123: the other dude was a fringe roster guy though. \nDNP_Old: I agree, kind of. Im sure hes excited to be back on the floor, but that was a bit strange.\nsmegdaddy: A crossover into a potential 4 point play in the face of the guy you just had to be separated from is pretty impressive. I like how you for some reason felt the need to post this in two threads too.\njakaloaf: Its kinda funny how I got downvoted a lot here but upvoted a lot in the other thread. Still came out to a net positive in redditpoints though yayy\nsmegdaddy: Probably because this play was actually impressive so you look genuinely stupid for saying Am I supposed to be impressed?\nthreekingmodest101: Wow. Someone kicked sand in your vagina. Have you ever heard of competitive spirit?\nDNP_Old: Was there some back and forth between them this game or something? I dont care about trash talk, but he got in some training camp fodders face after scoring on another dude. Then hip checked him and got in his face and walked away clapping like he just got in LeBrons head. It didnt look like the other dude really cared. Again, I dont care about trash talk, it was just strange to me.\nyaboi_95: Its bully season for the knicks boi\nadb1028: They have beef from Drew League, he said it in an interview after the game. Ware has played for the Sixers in the past I believe\nyanat1228: Probably Brandon Jennings\nalex_57_dieck: Jennings was pointing to his brain like its missing. I mean... what did Casper even do to him?\nGeneralShepard: Can we make a you must shoot over 40% to talk trash rule\nSteelBullets: Booooooo.The guy was non-existent when John Wall was in but as soon as our 3rd PG comes in he thinks hes Stephen Curry.\nPurple_9s: WE WON *\nSteelBullets: Yall won a preseason game \U0001f44f\U0001f3fe. Next step get a winning record.\ntyronewatermelon: Theyre one step ahead of you guys..\nSteelBullets: We swept yall. 4-0Dont talk.And we definitely had a winning record last year.\ntyronewatermelon: I really meant my first comment lightly, but you definitely didnt have a winning record last year, you were .500. The season after you swept us, you proceeded to miss the playoffs. We went to the conference finals and took the champs to 6. I just dont think a wizards fan is in any position to talk shit about the current situation of their team, hence why youre bringing up games from 2 seasons ago. \nSteelBullets: .500 was a winning record last season.Anddddd we still swept yall. Warriors will never live down their blowing of a 3-1 lead and Raptors will never live down getting swept in the playoffs.\nturddit: i cant wait for the video of him getting booed by NY fans when their team sucks and hes boring to watch off the bench in a couple months\nskimscanner: BJ just a back up player for teams now looool\n',

 'desc': u'whatthefuckingwhat: Are Americans not worried that there are so many cases of the water being polluted. Almost every week there is a new story abut water supplies being contaminated in some way or other.\nTypicalHaikuResponse: I am utterly saddened being against the EPA isnt an automatic disqualification as a politician\ndibblemunt44: The EPA doesnt seek to be doing a very good job\nPoopAndSunshine: Thats because congress keep cutting their funding and shrinking their authority to do anything. \nLastAXEL: They are completely underfunded and the right wing always blocks any policy changes they recommend. \nmachocamacho88: Shhhh, thats wrongthink...and remember, its all the fault of the Republicans!\nruffus4life: are we really debating on which party constantly says the epa kills jobs with unneeded regulation?\nmachocamacho88: Are we really debating that Democrats havent controlled the majority of the federal government since 2008?  Are we also really debating that Democrats do not make deals with Republicans behind closed doors?  Lets not pretend one party is any more culpable than the other.  Both Democrats and Republicans own this government, and both Democrats and Republicans are to blame.  Besides, with an estimated budget of 8.2 billion in 2017 for the EPA, why havent we heard about a single case being brought against a single entity in regards to all this chrom 6 magically appearing in our water tables nationwide?  At that many billion annually are they so cash strapped they cannot find one bad guy in all this?Also, while we are checking off your excuses which unneeded regulation prohibits the EPA from making sure our drinking water is safe?\nruffus4life: which party has used filibusters at a record amount to stop a multitude of legislation from being passed?\nmachocamacho88: Since you didnt answer my questions Ill ask again before answering yours.....which unneeded regulation prohibits the EPA from protecting our drinking water, and why hasnt the EPA found a single person/entity responsible for the chorm 6 in our nations drinking water?  Lemme guess, republicans?\nTruktyre: So your entire premise rests on the fact that in our two-party system, both parties are to blame for one party being obstructionist? Because...they must be in collusion behind closed doors?And all without a shred of evidence. Let me guess, you heard some people talking about it the other day...?\nmachocamacho88: No, I am simply saying Democrats and Republicans collectively failed America.  The evidence to this claim is in abundance...where would you like to start?\nTruktyre: Well, if you want to make it even more simple, the problem is the electorate, not the political parties. Who the hell do you think they are pandering to?We are living in a mess we created ourselves and blaming the political parties for pandering to us wont fix the problem, nor will simply blaming the gubment.What created the mess? As an example, look at the recent debates...there was zero substance and all finger-pointing and name calling. This is what America has asked for by bringing Donald Trump this far into the election process, because that is all Donald is...an election strategy of finger-pointing and name calling. He has no real thoughts about how to deal with any of our problems, and people dont care. They just want him to finger-point and name call which they reward with their support. \nasforalways: The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace. /sarcasm\nAldoTheeApache: I think that was the one and only time in the history of, like the earth, that someone has ever described Ohio as being .\nTeslaAddict: phenomenally flat...\nPokepokalypse: The smell of urine in downtown Cleveland is phenomenal.\nmachocamacho88: I mean if the EPA did their job and actually protected us you might have a point....but what exactly has the EPA done to stop Chrom 6 from winding up in our drinking water?  I get their mission but are they accomplishing it is the real question.....apparenty, according to this map, which shows chrom 6 levels for the entire country, the answer is a resounding no....because around 220 million of us have chromium 6 in our water, and So, you think the EPA deserves a medal on this one?\nthedracle: Perhaps years of discrediting the EPA, gutting their budget, and generally removing their power to regulate industry has something to do with it?\nEurycerus: Shocking how suddenly an agency seems useless when they have no budget...\nlookatmeimwhite: The EPAs budget increased overall between the years of 2000 to 2016]()Adjusting for inflation, the EPA had  money in 2010 than they had in 2000  (You can check that using the data I posted above in this inflation rate calculator  by nearly a .Adjusting for inflation from the years 2000 to 2016, we see that their budget has fallen (in real dollars) from $10,577,965,841 to $8,139,887,000.  Are you saying that, with 2 billion less dollars, the entire EPA is essentially ineffective at their entire reason for existing? I could understand they would be , but youre basically saying they shouldnt be held responsible for not doing their job because they have a little bit less money than they used to.TL;DR: I would hardly call this gutting their budget\nTypicalHaikuResponse: Thats 1/5th of their budget.   Assuming you were already underfunded then yes losing 1/5th is gutting.\nthedracle: +Error, does not compute, does not compute!Regardless I think an 8 billion dollar budget is paltry, and a 20% cut is pretty significant.But I suppose you have a point that its difficult to really gut something that never had a significant amount of money put into it to begin with.\nmachocamacho88: It seems the discredit was applicable.  Look at the state of our countrys drinking water...this isnt a joke anymore but apparently the EPA is.  I appreciate your desire to score ideological points, but for me its about results...or in the case of the EPA, a lack thereof.  Id prefer Erin Brockevich at this point, at least she got the job done.By the way did you check your local area?\nthedracle: My local area is Salt Lake Fucking City. And my infant Son drinks this water.So thanks for trying to score ideological points, but I think I am more familiar with my local politics and the reasons why the air here is unbreathable every winter, and how we have tried year after year with environmental advocates to change it.Our local politicians are all against the EPA, have worked for years to gut it, and then point out how ineffective it is.This seems almost like a strategy... Make a government program ineffective by gutting it, and then point to its ineffectiveness to do anything about the negative consequences to prove why it isnt needed.This nonsense logic is actually effecting peoples lives, and honestly Im sick and tired of it.\nhalf-dozen-cats: It is. Its called starve the beast.\nmachocamacho88: Thats a real shame.  I have two small girls and they have never once drunk our water, because I havent trusted our drinking water since the 90s.More like practical points.  By contrast, you lauded the EPA right out the gate but theyve failed.  You even went so far as to suggest any politician must be for the EPA as some sort of entrance requirement, yet accuse me of trying to score ideological points.  I think thats a bit strange personally.  Then you go off and make excuses for them like the excuses would be ok if your son came down with cancer at the age of 12.The EPA is a federal agency and their budget is decided at the federal level.  For someone who claims to understand the politics you sure...dont.  Therefore, in case you hadnt noticed, your local politicians cannot do a damn thing to the EPAs budget....so you should stop pretending to understand this thing immediately.Then stop drinking the big government kool aid.  Government is not the answer to every single problem.  In this particular case, for whatever reason, the government has failed to protect our drinking water, to the detriment of your young son, and my daughters...not to mention everyone else as well.  Maybe you should stop cheerleading for them.\nthedracle: The truth is we have very lax regulations federally, and the current administration and past ones, have constantly tried to expand the power and reach of the EPA, against the barrier of Local Governments claiming that they are doing it themselves already, and trying to keep Big Government hands off of their land and water ways.Local Governments cant use their failure to protect their own environment as evidence of the lack of need for the EPA, at the same time as claiming they dont need the EPA because they will protect their own lands and water ways.I find it really strange this type of logic. Its like pointing out the SEC did not prevent the economic collapse.So the solution isnt to try to improve the SEC, and produce a better regulatory environment.Its to gut the SEC, and get rid of all regulations.What are you people smoking?!I didnt laud them out of the gate, I simply replied that decades of gutting the EPA, railing against them, and local campaigns to prevent the EPA from doing its job, seem to have led to these circumstances specifically in states like my own that subscribe to this Libertarian nightmare of having as loose of environmental regulations as humanly possible.Utah year after year has chosen to enforce the bare minimum environmental standards federally mandated. To challenge in court attempts to expand the Clean Water and Clean Air act, and to continuously side with industry against the EPA with regards to those who violate regulations.They literally just challenged the current administrations attempt to expand the Clean Water rules very recently, and managed again to get them suspended in court:\nIve witnessed with my own eyes our local politicians here laughing at the ineffectiveness of the EPA, calling for Local Control over the water ways, and blaming the state of our air on Fog.You are the one pretending that local politics have nothing to do with the enforcement and effectiveness of federal laws and regulations.You cant drink your own water since the 90s... Not even to make Kool Aid with.This level of denial that your local Government is clearly failing you as far as providing a regulatory infrastructure that would make it so you can even drink water is astounding.\nmachocamacho88: Their land and their water is fine...Im talking about our water.  Also, you are speaking in generalities.  What specific regulation stopped the EPS from protecting our drinking water?How could they, the economic collapse was engineered by the Federal Reserve.  I find your attempted analogy strange and ill fitting.Seems like Democrats did not prioritize clean water when they held the super majority in Congress after Obama took the White Hosue.  We already know republicans arent too pro environement as a rule, but democrats prioritized Obamacare over clean water, and by the time they got around to addressing it things became deadlocked.  I gues thts what happens when someone says if you like your insurance you can keep it.  Oh well, you have to have priorities, and I guess the Insurance lobby was the priority of the day.I get it, it was a bi partisan team effort which failed us.You guys elected your local politicians.  We elected ours.  Seeems clear the old parties have to go.  One pretends to want to help and the other one doesnt bother.of course its failing me...just like its failing you....its failing all of us....but you wish to pretend it is all the fault of one party over the other, and if we just gave one party complete control there would be an enviornmental utopia with free college and healthcare for all...not to mention clean drinking water.  Well, democrats had that in 2008....  wheres the utopia?  Thats why the old parties have to go....theyve failed us.\nWINCHZ: How exactly did the Fed engineer the economic collapse?\nphysicster: What drinking water do you trust?\nPokepokalypse: Only rainwater and grain alcohol. \nmachocamacho88: Bottled from a Spring, but tbh, not sure I trust that anymore either.  It may very well be that our country has literally been posioned, and the EPA hasnt done one thing to change that, or to bring one single person to justice.\nphysicster: Perhaps you could use a  on the bottled water. Their test shows a > 99% Chromium-6 reduction.\nConan_the_enduser: The EPA is working exactly how Congress wants them to.\nmachocamacho88: I suppose we have Democrats and Republicans to blame for that.*truth hurts I suppose.\nWoodrow_Butnopaddle: We definitely do have both republican and democrats to blame, but removing the EPA isnt the answer - increasing their budget and their ability to actually regulate is the only thing going to solve environmental issues. You seem to care so much about removing pollutants from the water, yet you have not even once made any suggestions for what could be done as an improvement to the current situation... except to remove the administration that is tasked with finding solutions.\nNoMoreNicksLeft: There are problems in the world around us, and only the government can save us.\nwobbegongdong: EPA doesnt have standards for chromium-6. It has standards for chromium, but thats not what the EWG is talking about. The only enforceable standards for chromium-6 in the U.S. are held by the state of California, and those are 10.0 ppb. Only a few places on that map are in excess of that. \nmachocamacho88: Sorry, I meant California.....imagine that, a state coming up with something before the fedgov.  Who knew such a thing could happen.\nwobbegongdong: Happens all the time. Again, only a few places are actually in excess of the California standard.\nthatswhatshesaidxx: Nope.Clearly not.Yall went to war about where trans folks can go poop and piss but kinda shrug at the fact that the tap water aint even safe for hand washing.\nStorytellerVR: As long as the corporations who poisoned them dont have their bottom line impacted, I doubt Americans will care.Americans have been successfully brainwashed into having Stockholm syndrome towards the entities fucking them over, including those poisoning the basic necessities of life.\nwillyouswagme: Yeah im fucking worries\nladdersdazed: We are but no one seems to notice much, but then a lot of states/Americans dont notice climate change either. But this shit is scary.\nIam_Whysenhymer: Some of us are, while others are busy denying and exacerbating the problem. Its more than a little frustrating. At the same time, we have fairly strict limits set for contaminates so overall the water quality in the US is pretty good.\ndegoba: Im worried about it enough that Ive been buying or RO filtering all our water... Yeah, we are concerned. \nKind_Of_A_Dick: Its a presidential election year and the Olympics were also occurring, so people are too distracted by that.  Also, when people hear about the pollution, the first response is trying to figure out who to blame it on.  And those people in the media are very happy to help you decide who to blame, and once people have someone to blame they care less about solving the problem.  Of course, I could be wrong.\nAnotherComrade: Some of us are. The rest tell us to shut up while they vote the same fucks into office. R or D. Shut up and take it because the delusional majority believe thats a choice.\nfunkosaurus211: Mostly Im happy that we have testing and can find out about it, unlike other countries...\nOpionatedLulz: Nah, we are fond of conspiracy theories.  We all know Nestle wants to privatize water.  Theyre probably paying people to taint water supplies so more people buy any of their numerous water brands instead of trusting the tap.  They make 280,000%  mark up on bottled waters, after all.  \nmachocamacho88: It isnt just Utah.  Apparently, and for reasons which thus far have escaped the EPAs all pervasive ability to protect our environment, an estimated 220 million Americans now enjoy Chromium 6 in their drinking water ().  I remember when I was a kid back in the 70s the joke was if you ever go to Mexico dont drink the water....well jokes on us now.  Thanks EPA!\ncart1yn: I like my water with just the right amount of cancer-causing chromium-6.\nUSAOne: The Flint Michigan tourism board has elected you as their new President. Congratulations!\nZandivya: You can taste it when theres not enough. I get around that by flavoring my water with lead though.\nI_hate_alot_a_lot: Is there any additional filtering we can do to not get cancer or other things in our water? Are filters enough?\nwobbegongdong: EPA doesnt have standards for chromium-6. It has standards for chromium, but thats not what the EWG is talking about. The only enforceable standards for chromium-6 in the U.S. are held by the state of California, and those are 10.0 ppb -- obviously far higher than the suggested limit of 0.02 ppb, which is a smaller quantity than can be detected by most labs. That smaller amount is whats represented on the EWG map of counties. Only a few places on that map are in excess of the Californian limit of 10.0 ppb. There are probably much more serious carcinogens in your everyday life than chromium-6.\nhardolaf: Also, chromium-6 hasnt even been shown to be carcinogenic below 100 ppb which is the federal limit on all chromium in a water source.\nBonesnapcall: The same stuff Erin Brockovich fought against.\nUSAOne: Didnt she fight against high power lines going through low income communities? \nNomadFire: No you are thinking of\nace425: God damn this explains so much! I am super allergic to chromium thanks to years of occupational exposure. Whenever Im in Salt Lake City I always seem to get a super irritated stomach and break out in a nasty rash. This should be huge news. This should be a much bigger deal than the lead contamination up in Flint, Michigan. While lead exposure does have its own share of major health problems, Chromium-6, otherwise known as  is an aggressive  as well as a strong  and is suspected of being a possible . Hexavalent chromiums  is fairly well understood, however once exposure has occurred and the mutation has been made, the damage is permanent. The only silver lining to this is that exposure through ingestion has to be either higher in concentration, or lower levels for longer periods of time to have the same affects as exposure through air-born dust breathed into the lungs. That is not to say however that one is still safe from the effects though. This shit is serious. Much more serious than lead contamination in my opinion.Edit: spelling\nladdersdazed: There is only a few countys that have no measurement of it.\nGbcue: No it doesnt.  You have an anecdotal story.\nace425: It explains so much in to me personally in regards to why I seem to have a constant allergic reaction when Im staying in Salt Lake City and not when Im at home. Im not sure how that could have been misinterpreted to mean anything else?\nGbcue: Because the total chromium in SLC is non-existent throughout most of their water system.  Hex Chrome is a subset of total chromium.\nleninismycopilot: TIL  was made in Utah\nbuckethealien: This is a concern as it seems that new places are being identified with shitty water.  Should we all just assume that our water is crappy now?\nmachocamacho88: Pretty much, according to this   This is way beyond utah at this point.  Thank goodness for the EPA though.\nZandivya: Maybe we should switch from bottle water to beer. Itll make work much more interesting if nothing else.\nbuckethealien: Im all for that!  Just need a bus to bring me home at the end of the day.\ndontspeaksoftly: In CA, water departments send out annual reports that outline the amounts of contaminants. I dont know if other states do this, too, but its a good idea to call your water department and ask.\nGbcue: I dont understand the graph.  It says the CA MCL is 10ppb (technically 0.010 mg/L) yet the graph is way under 1 ppb.  Is that considered too much?  Its much lower than the stringent CA MCL?\nAggropop: I assume they meant chromium(VI), an oxidation state. There is no such thing as chromium-6.\nHRPaperStacks: No, it is chromium-6, chromium with -18 neutrons. Thats why its so scary.\nhashymika: Yes, its probably dichromate anion which is used as corrosion protection. Nowadays people have moved to molybdate which is found to be less toxic and works in a similar mechanism. \nAgent31984: There is always AQUAMAG (sodium ortho polyphosphate)which is magnesium hydroxide that can be used. Edit: Pulled up a data sheet and damnit contains traces of cromium. :( .05 mg/l\nLubricantMoon: Im thinking the chromium problem is made worse in areas with heavy aircraft maintenance. Many paints have chromate for corrosion resistance and sanding and spraying it gets it airborne. Then you have the workers getting it on them even with full ppe and going home and showering. Now you have it in your water also. I live near seattle, close to lots of aircraft maintenance, we have it in the water. Lived in idaho before here near a military base, had it there. SLC has an air force depot maintenance with lots of painting, they have it. I could be talking out of my ass but I work with the stuff and have noticed a pattern. \nGbcue: Whats hexavalent chromium?\nxZeroking: You must be so much fun at parties. \nbonerfiedmurican: In his defense I was really confused by chromium-6 too \nmeb9000: Wheres Erin Brokovich when we need her!?\nBU_Milksteak: I work with Cr pretty much every single day during the week. Its nasty stuff. \nhardolaf: There is no federal limit on Chromium-6 different than the maximum limit on Chromium in water.Currently in the US, no tested municipal water source comes within even 1/5 of the federal Chromium limit.The EPA in 2008 began a review of its Chromium regulations in drinking water but thus far have made no change as both the WHO and CDC have stated that the current limit is more than safe enough for human consumption.This article is based on the horrible CA EPA standards which were forced down their throats by the legislature who ignored scientists when forcing them to set the limit so ridiculously low.The only study that has shown risk of cancer from chromium-6 while following the federal EPA limits has been refuted by six other studies involving a much larger number of rats and has been unable to be reproduced in tests on four other species of animals.\ntheFunkiestButtLovin: americas political system has failed.\nmachocamacho88: Indeed, democrats and republicans have run this country into the ground.\ndibblemunt44: Chromium VI, not Chromium 6.\nIllpontification: They probably cant get their history to sync either \nsnowman030: Utahs levels of Chromium-6 are well below the EPAs maximum contaminant level, which is 10ppb. Whether or not the current set levels are safe is another discussion entirely. When you see the goal set for an area, thats exactly what it is, a goal. What is regarded as the legal limit is higher. In this case for California, much higher. \nGbcue: 0.02 ppb is practically undetectable for most labs.\nwobbegongdong: As far as I know, it is undetectable. Pretty sure results are only valid down to 0.03 ppb.\nPurpleTopp: Good thing I bought a Brita filter! These filters come in a variety of colors (mine is  ), and they come in two different sizes; 1 and 2 liters. The filtration options are easily modifiable with an intuitive analog interface and temperature reader! The filter is easy to replace and cheap. The container itself easily fits in any standard size refrigerator, and has a robust handle that makes pouring easy. The material is high grade and hard to break, but still easily lets the water refrigerate when chilled. No more little black speckles in your water! The containers also easily fit inside your sink when refilling. No more awkward angles or filling up cups to fill up your filter!Need any more information? Feel free to message me to learn more, or check out \nladdersdazed: Dont know if it will filter out this stuff but any filter would be better than no filter at all.\nscontra788: If I were a religious chap. Id say GOD is punishing Utah for their false prophet ways.\nladdersdazed: I spot coffee on my phone for that one...lol\nBacore: Hey but at least its helping to keep dental caries down by having fluoride, right?  \nJubguy3: Fluoride isnt causing cancer.\nAgent31984: In high doses it is a carcinogen. It also can cause severe osteoporosis if not metered correctly.I am a certified operator. The cons outweigh the pros when it comes to fluoride. Of course it does occur naturally in ground and surface water but in much lower concentrations then is what is injected into some supplies. I am thankful my system doesnt use it.\nJubguy3: In Utah its used in low quantities. Its not harmful to people, especially considering the sophistication of many of the metering systems. Calgary eliminated fluoride and saw a monumental increase in cavities\nAgent31984: I could tell you nightmare stories about those metering systems. It is indeed safe when metered correctly but I promise you in small system lazy operators dont care. The MCL for Flouride is 4 mg/L. I promise you that in many systems it is higher. That is why I dont like it. Also the form of fluoride that is used is dangerous as hell to the operator. \nmachocamacho88: Nah, its just a neurotoxin.\nimnotboo: Cant they just pray the cancer away?\nmetalflygon08: depends, is it gay?\nJubguy3: I was under the impression that all cancer was gay\nUSAOne: Finally, we understand way Trump has so much support in Utah. \nJubguy3: Hopefully the levels are less in Salt Lake City then... I literally do not know more than one Trump supporter in real life.\n',

 'desc': u'Betwixting: I would caution parents to never ever leave a young child in the hands of strangers, even medical professionals, unless essential and even then not before you have had a chance to assess whether you can trust the individuals. While parents cannot be expected to know the rules for anesthesia procedures, if something just does not seem right and proper, take the child and leave. I am so sorry what happened to this child. Parents are the best advocates for their children. Just because someone is a professional does not necessarily mean the interests of the child are foremost in that persons mind. Maybe they are in a hurry or have other priorities and concerns. When my daughter was 5, she fell at school and split her chin open requiring stitches. We were assigned a young resident to do the stitching. My daughter had ceased crying until the guy ordered the nurse to put her in a straight jacket whereupon she got scared and began wailing. As I tried to reassure her, the resident ordered me to leave. I refused. He bullied me but I stayed put. Then he picked up an entire tray of instruments and literally threw them on the floor. The ear-splitting crash brought several other nurses into the room. At that point, I removed the straight jacket and said I would take her to another hospital. One of the nurses, apparently the charge nurse, asked me to please wait while she motioned everyone including the bully out of the room. Soon, the head of surgery came down and stitched her up efficiently and peacefully. No muss, no fuss, no wailing, no straight jacket.... and no unsightly scars later.\nSkeenip: Wait, he wanted to put a child in a STRAIGHTJACKET??? Seriously? I would start wailing too if somebody put me in a straightjacket. Is that a normal thing to do to kids in a medical setting?\nIRNGNEER: Its normal for small children with facial injuries. Remember this is a frightened and injured child with sharp surgical instruments being used on her face. Any jerk or surprise reaction, whether intentional or not, could cause a lot of serious damage to the little patient. Best to immobilize them long enough to get the job done and ensure nothing catastrophic happens along the way. \nEurycerus: Doctors thought I may have spinal meningitis when I was 1.5 years old or so. They forced my mom to leave the room for the spinal tap and four nurses pinned me down. My mom said she could hear me screaming down the hall. She still gets upset and thinks if shes been there I wouldve been more calm. Im inclined to believe thats true.Is it any shock that I have anxiety attacks (sweating, hair pulling, hyperventilating, vertigo) around needles? No, no its not. \nMurrrrdawg: This is a tough one man. Im sorry you had such a shitty experience.Lumbar punctures are not a fun procedure to watch-- even with a very well trained physician it can take a few tries to find the right spot, and no one likes to watch someone dig in their kids back with a needle. At my institution it is pretty routine to have parents step out of the room for this procedure \nWest_Covina: I think it depends on the situation. If a parent is really emotional and theres a risk for them interfering with a sterile/delicate procedure, then waiting outside might be better overall. Spinal taps are unpleasant for everybody involved - but you can die from meningitis. \nPossibly_a_Firetruck: Thats totally normal to clear the room for a spinal procedure like that. They held you down because if you started thrashing around you could have ended up paralyzed. \nMoisturizing_Sand: prob not. \nUpboats_Ahoys: And people think barbarism doesnt exist in the US. :/\nTrendamony: Here is where I think many new parents make mistakes.\nkrackbaby2: Gotta keep that stranger danger fear going!\nCWRUW4: well, have fun with your brain damaged 4 year old then...theres nothing wrong with being present in the room with medical professionals and your kid...isnt that like the norm? Wtf else am I gonna do, wander around the hallways?\nkrackbaby2: Under no circumstances have parents ever been allowed in the operating room for about a billion good reasons\nWest_Covina: Wow thats so weird, when I was a kid I cut the bottom of my chin open and need stitches.... on 3 separate occasions lol. I definitely dont agree with the use of a straight jacket or with banishing parents. But I used to work in the ER as a tech and saw many young kids get stitches. Wrapping really young kids up in a blanket or sheet and holding them still is actually pretty common, even if they are momentarily calm. The problem is you never know if/when they will suddenly jerk or move, and with a sharp tool in hand, that could be really bad (especially with facial/head stitches). The physician I helped most often was fantastic with young kids and explaining things to their parents though. Our ER also had specialists that worked in the pedi section and entertained kids with toys, books, etc. to distract them. That particular resident sounds pretty terrible though...\nHammedatha: Eh, Id trust medical professionals over random parents pretty much any day. \nwitchsbrew: Depends what city... the medical professionals who end up in Bakersfield? Not so much...\n89fruits89: Uh pretty sure we know what happened. Dentist was a retard and should get a murder charge. While he was there, no intubation or heart monitoring or [blood pressure] rate check was done. We dont know what happened after that.\npm-me-neckbeards: Yeah, and it was says it was general anesthesia, AND she had eaten. With no monitoring....what was the dentist thinking?\ndookieface: what does general anesthesia and food have to do with each other? \npm-me-neckbeards: If you eat within  4-8 apparently hours, of being put under, you can vomit and aspirate. Even my vet tells me not to feed my dog before she is going to knock him out. \nstopie1: Current American Society of Anesthesiology guidelines are 8 hours after a large or fatty meal, 6 for a small meal or infant formula, 4 hours for breast milk, and 2 hours for clear liquids. Aspiration is indeed the risk that is attempting to be avoided by NPO guidelines.\npm-me-neckbeards: I hope that this is not what went wrong being such a simple thing to avoid =(I guess its not better if it was just general incompetence, but if they all knew she ate and still did it and aspiration ended up causing her death...that is just so avoidable in this situation it seems.\nstopie1: Its super tragic and the relatives story is scary as hell. Ignoring NPO status, no monitors for induction, talking to the family while waiting for paramedics to arrive instead of maybe taking care of the coding patient. Sketchy as shit :-(\npm-me-neckbeards: Its so sad. She should never have had to have that kind of work done at 7 to start with, then to ignore all safety and just let her not be breathing? Heartbreaking all around. \nNinjakick666: Cause you go under and the muscles in the stomach get all relaxed and you dont want to have a bunch of stuff in there that could end up in your lungs. Cause lungs work best full of air, not full of bagel bites and bile. \nAproSamurai: The anesthesia also relaxes the muscles in our digestive tract which normally prevent the contents of our stomaches from being inhaled into our lungs. So what those above us are saying is that, she stopped breathing due to something most likely being inhaled and causing her to suffocate, which is why any sort of monitoring would have been good and informed them of the change which may not have been visible as it was happening. Its pure negligence on the dentists part, this poor little girl didnt deserve all of this. \nkrackbaby2: You can vomit and aspirate it, then die. If we find out a patient has had anything but ice chips after midnight, we cancel the procedure\nExcelius: Apparently this is not an uncommon problem:I had my wisdom teeth removed under general anesthesia when I was a teenager, which was my first-ever surgery.  Later on I developed some unrelated health problems which required a few other surgeries.  It wasnt until seeing everything they did in the hospital setting, that I realized just how lacking the anesthesia care was at the oral surgeons office.  It was just the oral surgeon and his nurse, and I dont think there was any heart rate or blood pressure monitoring.  When I woke up I had basically been wheeled into a glorified closet with a curtain over the door, with nobody around because the surgeon had already started working on the next patient.  Eventually I worked up the strength to get out of the bed, get myself dressed, and find someone to discharge me.\nFishwithadeagle: I asked my oral surgeon if it was conscious sedation or full anesthesia. He assured me that it was conscious sedation. Im sitting there before a major oral surgery and I see them injecting propofol, and I remember being absolutely pissed about it. Additionally, he pushed for the removal of some teeth still coming in (as a younger teen) and even I could see that the tooth was still way too close to the nerve in the jaw, but parents being parents made me go through with it. After that surgery I had nerve damage because guess what, the tooth was too close to the nerve and he damaged it. In all honestly I probably should have sued for lying about the methods of sedation and what not, but of course they have the bulletproof liability waiver. \nCanadian_Girl_: I had metal plates screwed into my upper jaw. He screwed right through the nerve, fucking idiot.My orthodontist was pissed that he actually managed to install the damn thing 1cm away from where it was supposed to be.I was lucky though. After getting it removed two years later, my nerve started healing and I regained most sensations. But those two years were pure pain.\nkrackbaby2: Propofol can be used for sedation or general anesthesia.The more you know!\nImranRashid: Sedation always brings a risk, dentistry or otherwise.\nblade55555: I mean I dont think 31 deaths is that much over a 15 year period. Thats pretty uncommon in my eyes. Still something that shouldnt happen and the dentist you went to sounds really fucking shitty.Before I had my wisdom teeth removed (under anesthesia as well) I made sure the place I was going to was good. Im always paranoid about mistakes or if they are shitty. \nRaven_Skyhawk: 31 out of many thousands isnt, likely there are a few that arent reported but its still a small percent. Is it awful? Yes. Common? Not really.\nEurycerus: Why did they do full general anesthesia as opposed to twilight? You dont intubate for twilight (I had it done for wisdom teeth removal and other things, Ive had general as well). Very confusing.\nFishwithadeagle: You say this, but most dentists in this regard are quire idiotic. A lot do very minimal if no monitoring, and most if not all dentists due not intubate. \npm-me-neckbeards: There are not a lot of good reasons for a 7 year old to have decay that advanced. \nBeareh: This is absolutely depressing. I hope the dentist is charged. \nkrackbaby2: For what?\n(6 children): \nAlt4ScrewdriverOo: Its not 2067 or later and were not hopefully in the Fallout universe, so Edmonton, Alberta isnt in the US. \nIamtheHoffman: This is in Canada.\nDr__Doofenschmirtz: Last I knew the city of Edmonton was in Alberta Canada... The Stollery Childrens Hospital is in Canada as well.btw is CanadaSo the question is, did you bother to read the article?\nAlt4ScrewdriverOo: Im going with no, no he did not.\nDr_Nikk: This happened in Edmonton?\nTriggered_SJW: Found the ignorant European.\nBlack_Punisher: This is why I didnt believe the doctor who told me I was obese. What the fuck do they know??? In the UK some NHS asshole put hot glue in a girls brain.\nMurrrrdawg: Being obese is not a subjective thing. Your BMI either falls into that range or it does not \n',

Chinas gonna start outsourcing its organ harvesting program to the Philippines in the near future.\nJustAnotherPot: Without even reading the article I predict this is about FLG. Seriously, fuck them.\nyo-yo-baggins: I know zero about FLG EXCEPT that China is putting these guys in jail left and right for there religious beliefs.So why Fuck them?\nJustAnotherPot: My uncle bought full heartedly into their bullshit. Didnt seek treatment for a very treatable disease. Now has permanent liver damage.\nyo-yo-baggins: My point exactly.  Your uncle isnt the one that are doing the reprehensible stuff.  The people above him that are writing and dicatating what people will believe and how they will act, THOSE people are responsible.  Your Uncle is innocent.\nJustAnotherPot: Guess what? The dumb fucks who are propagating this are just as bad as the guy who started it. Thats like saying Jenny Mccarthy didnt start the antivaccine movement, so shes innocent\nleochen: Hey, the guy who started this reprehensible shit is enjoying his life under US protection.\nFolseit: They are the Chinese near-equivalent of Scientology. \nyo-yo-baggins: And?\nI dont like Scientology any more then the next guy.   But if the US government decided to suddenly throw all Scientologists in prison simply because they were Scientologists, I would be in the Scientologists corner.Now I am not speaking from conjecture here, this is reality, the Scientology higher ups are doing things that are terrible and illegal.  But your average Scientologist is not.Is that what these people are doing?  Or are the average people doing something that deserves imprisonment?\nhsm4ever11: you have to remember China is a pseudo-dictatorship. Anything that might threaten the absolute commandment of the Communist Party is heavily oppressed. FLG has some political conflicts with communism, so theyre destroyed by the government.\nyo-yo-baggins: Right.  But the response I was going after was FLG, fuck those guys..I dont know what they are doing that from our point of view (free world) they deserve a fuck those guys.  \nBigPhoCup: Basically a cult based on the idea that illness is spiritual and that you need to pray/meditate away the sickness instead of going to a doctor. The chinese government went after them, Im guessing because it was some people were dying but more importantly health care costs were rising due to people not seeking treatment in time. The leader of the cult fled/was run out of china. Now the cult does a lot of anti chinese government stuff, so the chinese government goes after them harder.  They are the people that are always outside the chinese embassies protesting. \nmyempire1: From the US Embassy site.U.S. Finds No Evidence of Alleged Concentration Camp in ChinaU.S. representatives have found no evidence to support allegations that a site in northeast China has been used as a concentration camp to jail Falun Gong practitioners and harvest their organs, according to the U.S. Department of State.\nslickyslickslick: Its funny how the Falun Gong cultists keep putting this shit up yet they keep getting shut down in every thread. People would have to be simple-minded idiots to keep believing this made-up shit.inb4 CCP shills:, the most anti-CCP place on Reddit, also says that \nmyempire1: Look how few numbers their demonstrations have. No support among actual Chinese people, either on the mainland or overseas. No credible organization takes the issue seriously. US Embassy investigated and found nothing. Even other activists like Harry Wu (famous for being imprisoned in labor camps for some 19 years) question it. There are good reasons for all these things.Maybe the one thing that sub has in common with . But the truth is it doesnt matter how many people believe this. Everybody needs a hobby I guess, so theres at least that.\nmedical1987:  is a delusional shit hole. The whole sub is sad and patheticIf you dont believe me try posting a negative article there. Guarantee you will be banned. Any sub that controls discussion by banning criticism is  automatically shit in my opinion\nHam_Syde: In  the attitude towards the Falun Gong is mixed. Dont pretend like you speak for all of us. Its an indisputable fact that the Falun Gong were/are heavily oppressed in the mainland by the CCP. I dont know if there is any sort of concentration camp dedicated solely to Falun Gong members, but it doesnt negate the fact that they have been arrested and imprisoned en masse before. We just dont have a whole lot of proof about what happens after that.\npresbitalien: well if the us embassy says it then it must be true. \nElijahMatthew344: This looks like a Falun gong protest. Theyve been banging on about this for years outside the Chinese embassy. Very much a crazy cult from what I understand.\nkomnenos: Yeah, Im by no means pro CCP but the Falun Gong are crazy on a whole nother level.  \nDoing-The-Needful: lol hows NZ going to stop China?  thats like a mouse stopping a kodiak bear.\nmsison1229: Unless its Mighty Mouse\nRisker34: Maybe theyre allergic to kiwis?\nkurga_nova: That reminds me I need to renew my liver lease. \nFreddyBrysen24: Oh, I bet this is about Falun Gong crackpots.Falun GongYup.The Scientology of China who literally wants to overthrow the Chinese government.Whenever you hear accusations of industrial-style organ harvesting by the Chinese government, you can be pretty sure to find Falun Gong or someone influenced by Falun Gong propaganda.The spam their bullshit everywhere. They brigade Wikipedia. They file their own reports. Every report and all the propaganda of how China harvests prisoners organs comes from them.Its impressive how their anti-government propaganda is working.They are nutjobs.\no3dipusr3x: So I dont know anything about the Falun Gong religion but why is this considered propaganda and not actual organ harvesting? Im Korean and its pretty well known that Korea has a major human organ harvesting problem. Its often the main topic of our horror/suspense movies.  \nhsm4ever11: Thats what the Chinese media says. You should know that the media in that country is in complete control of the government.I see you haved been brainwashed by the Chinese propaganda.\nkomnenos: What frustrates me is how many English language news sources on China are funded by them.\nsparky135: Now I am wondering who is really the troll here.\nDownWithPastryarchy: If this was any other article that just so happened to contain anything involving certain topics it would be removed for not being US news only. This has been up 8 hours now. Whys that? \nsparky135: Is this a fake report?\nIm not being sarcastic, I really know little about this.\nminchuu: In my university in Toronto, there are a few elderly Chinese persons that usually hand out pamphlets asking to stop organ harvesting in China. No one really pays attention to them, and I think one of the reasons is that these pamphlets are full of gore and graphic images of human innards (or people are just too busy to care). I respect their activism, but seeing gore first thing in the morning does not seem very pleasing.\nkomnenos: What organization are they part of?\njbisinla: The Fifty Cent Army is here trying to debunk these claims.Id encourage everyone to do their own homework and make their own decisions.\ndiamondfound: I want to know what I can do about this issue.  Just knowing that it is going on is not enough.  I understand this is a profit making enterprise of the Chinese government.  Horrible!  How can we bring light to this issue?  Should we boycott Chinese products?  \ndan603311: So youre going to live inside a tent in the wild or something? Oh, Im sorry, no tent. That shits also probably made in China.\nOK_Compooper: You can start by boycotting Chinese organs.\nCytoid: Im proud of my American stomach!\nweaponofmd: Its a story manufactured by FLG to gain empathy. \n(3 children): \n123instantname: If theres a lack of evidence on both sides, you should not believe the initial claim. Because its impossible to prove a negative.Otherwise I can claim that everything is just a hoax made up by the reptilian race, and since theres no evidence that its false you wouldnt know what to believe?Isnt it suspicious that the only people who make the claim about organ harvesting are cultists? And since its so common, shouldnt they have some evidence other than eyewitness accounts from other falun gong practitioners?\njbisinla: Do your own homework. Google Chinese Organ Harvesting and see what you find. Its not nearly as much of a manufactured story as people would have you believe.\n',

 'desc': u'Innerouterself: I used to work in non-profit management and in churches.  Its pretty simple. Every area has specific zoning laws and acceptable use laws. It does not take much to figure out what they are, fill out paperwork, and petition for changes. Some areas are VERY open to changes, some not.  What churches and non-profits tend to do is break zoning and local laws while screaming but we are doing the lords work, how can you punish us?.  It cant be that hard to find some vacant land or unused land of someone in the congregation or area that would be fine with the mom and kid staying on their property for a period of time.  they could also work out a deal with the county/town without much hassle if they approach them first instead of in anger after.  Churches tend to be bad neighbors. They do not pay taxes and require special use (sometimes even police to direct traffic, overuse of residential roads etc).  The pastors intentions are fine and dandy. But it can get out of hand very quickly. There are normally very easy to be a part of service programs for people just like her. There are probably 2-3 shelters specifically for women and children within a thirty minute drive of the church.  For a good documentary on what out of hand means- check this one out Again, its easy to say but we need to help people. It can be very very complicated in practice. \nRtreesaccount420: I think the point of this is that it should not be a complicated process.\nGhostOfCardozo: Good thing its not.\nvegabond007: While I can certainly understand your point here, Churches represent a huge resource for the homeless. If states and the government want to stop dealing with these issues, then they need to put in effective ways to help these people. That includes economic policies that give people a base income to live on, drug policies that help people instead of making them further victims of their drug use, etc. Demonizing/fining churches, or people in general who wish to help them is not helpful and simply speaks to the governments lack of ability to properly deal with the issue. It is not effective and anyone who gets a fine for doing such should simply look at the officer or state official who wrote it, tear it up, and tell them to spend their time solving the issue instead of trying fine people assisting another in need. Treat the real issues, not the side effects. \nKang_andor_Kodos: Heres my question:  The priest says this process is too expensive.  Do you know how much it costs to rezone?  \nInnerouterself: He said that becoming a campground is too expensive due to construction costs.  Rezoning or getting a special use permit usually is very little cost at all depending on the area. His heart is in the right place but there are other ways to help.\nSinhumane: if its zoned residential and the code allows it, pull the wheels off and put it on a cinder block foundation. less than a certain sqft, and its free of permits in some places. and can be classified an ADU. that, or move it to an RV park and pay the fee.\nnotevenapro: I would have a problem if one of the churches in my neighborhood started an rv park on their property. You want to help? Pay for the rv at a camp ground. You want more say so in running your property? Start by paying taxes.\nComatoseSixty: I dont think anyone cares about a private citizen minding business that isnt their own. \nAustinTransmog: Yeah...but thats not whats happening here.Thats one way to help. It involves extra expense, though. This pastor is trying to help as much as possible, using his current resources.  The RV is already on the property. Its been vacant. No one complained. The objection occurred when he let a homeless woman stay in it. Churches  pay taxes. They dont pay income taxes, but they pay for property taxes. While Im the first to say that churches shouldnt be exempt from any tax, in this case its orthogonal to the issue. The church pays property tax, which is used for local public services. Furthermore, paying more taxes wouldnt make a bit of difference.  This issue has nothing to do with taxes. Its pretty clear to me that someone from the church reported the pastor for a zoning violation. It was probably somebody like you, someone who feels that the letter of the law is more important than the spirit of goodwill. And, ostensibly, thats fine. Ostensibly, the laws are in place for good reason. If the application of the law to this situation seems unfair to local residents, then perhaps the law needs to be updated. But I think most people object to laws which prevent charitable acts of goodwill and/or laws which obstruct people from helping their fellow man. Thats why this story is in the news.\nnotevenapro: The extra expense is ok. The church is a large charity organization. They do not pay taxes because they help people. But that help should not come at the expense of the people paying the taxes that enable the church to be tax free. Depends. I do not live next to a church. The nearest one is two blocks away. I do not live in a swanky place with half million dollar homes, but if I did it would be a different story. Poverty = higher crime rate. i think that is universally understood. If I lived next to or near a church that turned its parking lot in to an RV camp to help the poor I would have an issue with that. Why? Because I moved to an area with nice homes in a nice neighborhood for the low crime rate and better schools. It can be a little complex but churches can file tax exempt status for property that is used for religious or educational reasons. In my county there is 9 billion, yes 9,000,000,000 worth of tax exempt property. Not all of that is church owned land. This accounts for about 97 million in lost taxes a year. Not a huge amount of money in a county where the school budget is 2 billion dollars. But you get the idea. It is just my train of thought that is; we give the churches tax breaks because they help people who would otherwise get government assistance. Even though the assistance people get from a church is not counted when applying for government assistance. Churches also use the money they get from not paying taxes to push an agenda that I do not agree with. If an organization is skirting zoning laws, an organization who pushes a social agenda I do not agree with, you better bet I will call the zoning board on them. \nTriggered_SJW: When are people going to learn that the government and the government alone is allowed to help people.  They want a monopoly on helping people so they can justify the absurd taxes the increase on us every year.\npm_me_gnus: Yes, thats why every non-government charitable organization is shut down immediately. Good point. Thanks for bringing that up.Did you consider that they might have a problem with someone running an RV campground in a location that isnt set up for it? Wheres here water coming from? Where does she empty her toilet? Zoning laws and related codes exist, and are enforced, for a reason. Its wonderful that this pastor wants to help someone in need. However, good intentions do not supersede the law. \nTriggered_SJW: Yeah, so the government can have even more control over peoples lives and collect even more money from the people by making them get permission to use land that they own.\nsuperm8n: If they really owned it, would they have to pay taxes?\nTriggered_SJW: Well that is a good point.  The idea that anybody owns property in this country is kind of wrong. \nsuperm8n: If I sold you a pencil for five cents and then required you to pay for it again, five cents every week, is it really yours?\nTriggered_SJW: Well that analogy is not right though.  The government generally isnt the one selling property (except in a handful of cases) and the property tax is not 100% of the cost of the property every week.  People spend 20-30 years paying off a property, there is no way they could also pay the government that amount every week.\nsuperm8n: I agree.\nInsideOfYourMind: I take this back. \n',

 'desc': u'Farkerisme: Did any of his relatives indicate he might have been on drugs?\nSorospaidrioter: They said he was a good guy and wouldnt do anything like this\nTriggered_SJW: His relatives probably still dont believe he was on drugs.\nFarkerisme: I would imagine so.  But still, something to corroborate, I would imagine, if you felt it might come out later.  Say, after a blood test.To be honest, though, I doubt that he was on anything, personally.   It just strikes me as too convenient.  \nNerdlinger: Did he have IP or UDP on top of that TCP?\nIm-Currently-Working: I heard they think he had UDP in his system, but there was no acknowledgement. \nYouAintGotToLieCraig: I could tell you a joke about UDP but you might not get it.\nSeeArizonaBay: Im sure youd get my TCP joke, though.\nmad_poet_navarth: To be accurate, UDP and TCP are peers, with IP underneath. Not familiar with PCP. Ill see if theres a related rfc.\nnotreallyhereforthis: Good ole \nmad_poet_navarth: :)Another networking nerd!\nNerdlinger: Goddamnit! Youre right.Theres still a good TCP joke somewhere to be made. \nRandomStrategy: Try another  if this one has too many  to jump through.\nGoCubsGo2007: While being on PCP isnt a reason to kill someone, this information will be used in the trial for the police officer.  There have been instances where people on PCP have absorbed many gun shots and still attacked officers.  Those other instances shouldnt have an impact on her judgement in the field, but it will probably impact the jurys ability to find her guilty. The officer now has the defense that she was scared due to him being on PCP.  It was my understanding that from her view, it looked like he was reaching into the car for something so if you combine that with him being on PCP, the jury will probably find her not guilty. Was she in the right? No. Do I think she went into the situation thinking Im going to gun this guy down for no reason? No. Do I think she was scared and acted to hastily? Yes. She probably shouldnt be an officer anymore if she cant handle stressful and scary situations. I dont know all of the facts in this case because I wasnt there to experience what she did but it seems like she is in the wrong. However, I dont think a jury is going to find her guilty given what we know. \nBoshasaurus_Rex: She didnt know he was on PCP at the time and he could not have reached into the car because the door was closed and the window was rolled up. She doesnt really have a strong case, but shes a cop so shell probably walk anyways.\nGoCubsGo2007: An experienced officer can most likely tell if someone is on some kind of drug. They should not rely on their own judgement for that though. While I think she was wrong, I can see the case they will present and can understand what the jury will do here. \nBoshasaurus_Rex: I dont see how a calm guy with his hands in the air is indicative of being on drugs. If he was running around being violent and belligerent, but he seems normal on video.This appears to be the standard police protocol of taking knowledge gained after the fact to smear the deceased and get the cop off.\nGoCubsGo2007: That could be true. But we cant hear what the guy is saying or anything like that. Maybe it was obvious to her that he was on PCP. If you experience enough people on it, Im sure you would be able to determine if someone is on it with decent accuracy. Still no reason to shoot the guy though.  \nDesalvo23: I worked the psych ward and the ER in a hospital.. It would be extremely difficult for someone to accurately know if he was on drugs or in psychological distress. \njpe77: He was wacked out of his mind and she had been trained in drug recognition.That she knew he was on PCP is basically a gimme.\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Thats pure speculation, he was calm cool and collected in all the footage we have.\njpe77: We have witness testimony that he was wacked out of his head. The cop will testify to that, as will several other witnesses.\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Can you source any of that? Theres one 9-11 call that claims he mat have been smoking but thats hardly being whacked out of his head and it certainly doesnt match the video. \nGoCubsGo2007: Also, I thought the window was down. Im at work and cant watch the video. Can someone confirm whether the window is up or down? This is information the jury would want to know I think. \nBoshasaurus_Rex: . The window was up the entire time, you can see his blood smeared on it.\nGoCubsGo2007: Again, i cant watch the video due to being at work. I was hoping for confirmation from some other people. Edit: sorry I thought it was a video. Yes it does appear that the window was up. Not saying its right, but I still think the jury will find her not guilty. There will be 1 person who will find her innocent. Historically, that seems to be how these things go. \njpe77: Youre describing a mistrial.\nboston_shua: For anyone who forgot - \njpe77: That was the original reporting. We know from the 911 calls that he stopped his car in the middle of the street and ran out, leaving the car running and the door open, because he thought the car was going to explode.Im guessing the PCP had something to do with that. \netherealducky: Is that the best picture they could get of him ? His eyes are fucking closed in that one. \nRemoteWrathEmitter: I can understand being high on PCP, but getting fucked up on transmission control protocol?! This guy was hardcore.\nwelfarecuban: Why was he operating a motor vehicle on the highway if he was using PCP?  Thats not legal.  I wonder what other parts of the official narrative here dont add up...\nStan57: lol drinking and driving is against the law and millions are arrested every year. people break laws your comment is puzzling you getting +9 is even more puzzling\nsubpoenis: Its also not punishable by death.\nwelfarecuban: Non sequitur.  The initial media narrative of this story was that a pastor was mercilessly gunned down by a deranged female cop for no reason.Now we find out that he was illegally operating a motor vehicle while high on PCP, a powerful psychoactive substance known specifically for causing erratic and violent behavior in its users...\nGoCubsGo2007: This is semi irrelevant to the case but still semi-interesting in regards to PCP use. I know an older small town police officer who responded to a call of a man acting erratically on the interstate near his town. He was the first to arrive and as he pulled up to the scene, the man started charging the officer after he got out of the car. The man was wielding a bat or a pipe, cant remember which. Anyways, the cop shot the man 6 or 7 times with his .38 revolver and the guy kept charging him.  He had to reload and shoot him several more times before he went down. The man trying to attack the cop was on PCP. After the incident, he was talking with the state police and told them how many rounds it took to get the guy on the ground. The state police said in areas where PCP use is rampant, some police offices carry .44 magnums or .45 acp because it does a better job of stopping guys on PCP. As I said, not relevant to this case but I find it interesting the affects PCP can have on the human body.  \nTriggered_SJW: He also stopped his vehicle in the middle of the road instead of the side of the road.  Also not normal behavior.\nPandaBearMcSausage: Both parties can be guilty of different crimes here.  The guy was using and DUI.  But the cop also screwed up.  Unfortunately one party did not survive to see a courtroom.\nR_BirthStrike: This.  Everyone please repeat after me: the wrongs of one party do not absolve the wrongs of another party.Use of violent response must be proportionate to the level of threat presented.\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Thats nice but he wasnt violent, as shown on video. Dude had his hands in the air and was calm the entire time.  So saying PCP makes people dangerous doesnt make him a threat, because he never was. \nspanishprincess7: It is if he puts other peoples lives in danger\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Good thing he didnt put anyones life in danger at any point. \njcam12: he was still shot while not posing a threat, doesnt matter what was in his system\njpe77: It goes into the facts & circumstances for whether the cop had a reasonable fear. She saw a drugged up guy disobeying commands and walking back to his car. If the prosecution cant prove he wasnt reaching for something, the facts together will it make it hard to get a conviction.\nAelinsaar: Unless she had magical chemical sensors in her eyeballs...\njpe77: Because PCP users are so subtle.\nAelinsaar: It depends on the user and the dose, but I understand thats a bit too much like thinking for you. :)\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Pretty easy to prove he wasnt reaching for anything when  show the car door closed and the window rolled up. Edit: Looks like the brigade is here to downvote sourced facts lol\ncccp_redr4bbit: That looks like the window is rolled down actually compared to the back seat window\nIz-kan-reddit: Theres been supposition that the window smear may actually be the seat belt. Id like to see the crime scene photos.Supposedly, the reason shes been charged is because she had already cleared that part of the vehicle, making any reaching irrelevant.\nGarden_Dad: Which is complete bullshit. I dont care if the guy was on drugs, excessive force is excessive force, and with her past, I dont think they are going to have too hard a time proving anything.\njpe77: Of course you dont care that he was on PCP, walking back to his car despite cops telling him not to, and then reaching for something.The jury will, though. this will be the central factual question of the trial. If the prosecution can prove he wasnt reaching for something, theres a good chance shell be found guilty. Otherwise, not so much.\nGarden_Dad: So having a few beers makes it cool for cops to jump the gun too?  The fact that Rodney King was on PCP made the beating A-Ok?Proof?  Like any of it?Which is dumb because they could have subdues him way before he got back to his car.  But they just let him mosey on back.\nAelinsaar: Just think... you could have made that comment at any time in the last century and youd be singing the same tune as the worst people youll ever meet. Stay proud.\njcam12: I watched the video from he helicopter - he wasnt a threat, or else the other 5 cops would have done something about it instead of Mrs. Iscaretooeasily being the only one to open fire.  They are just trying to  paint a picture that stirs the pot\njpe77: The guy with the taser fired at the same time. IOW, they were both responding to the same action by Crutcher.\njcam12: i would say that he went the proper route then - id be willing to bet that she will bring that up as part of her defense;  the taser firing off startled me into unloading on Crutcher.   This all just reinforces my belief that if you perceive most situations as being life threatening then you shouldnt be a cop\nGoCubsGo2007: How many bullets did the officer fire? Was it one bullet?\njcam12: I think it was one - I can see how saying unloading can be perceived to mean multiple rounds being fired though\nGoCubsGo2007: In the eyes of the jury, the number of shots fired could show intent. If she fired one round, I could see how that would be an accident. You have your gun drawn, adrenaline flowing and you hear a startling noise, I could see how you could accidentally fire off one round.  Doesnt make it right, but in the eyes of the jury, this could make a difference. And yes, unloading is the wrong word to use. If she was carrying a glock, the different between unloading and 1 round could be 15. Theres a big difference between firing 1 versus all 16.  \njcam12: then they charged her appropriately with manslaughter instead of murder - she put herself into a situation that resulted in someone being killed, it may not have been on purpose - but much like a drunk driver crashing and killing someone they get manslaughter charges because they didnt do it on purpose but they still did it.  The biggest issue I have with it is that nobody else fired a shot despite being in the same situation.  If she gets spooked so easily then she shouldnt have been a cop to begin with\nGoCubsGo2007: I agree that you shouldnt be a cop if you scare easily. I will say that its difficult to know how you will react in a situation like that until you are put into the situation.  Manslaughter seems like an appropriate thing to charger her with. There is no way a jury would find her guilty of murder.  Whether or not she should be tried for murder is a completely different topic. I doubt the prosecutor would even try for murder if they knew the jury wouldnt find her guilty. At least try her for something you realistically think might happen \njpe77: Thats sort of what we pay cops to do: their job is to go into dangerous situations. The question is whether she acted how a reasonable officer would in light of the facts and circumstances. \nDesalvo23: I was taught to only put my finger on the trigger once i was ready to shoot.. Why did she have her finger on the trigger\nGoCubsGo2007: She was training incorrectly? Fuck if I know. Im sure you know or have seen people who dont follow every rule of gun safety at all times. Im fully aware that I dont follow every rule all the time. Human error exists\njack_burdens_phd: she could read toxicology results just standing on the freeway? amazing. lol facts and circumstances. youre either a shitty lawyer, shitty law student, or a cop; or, more likely, someone who aspires to be. \njpe77: That he was on drugs was so obvious that two 911 callers said he was probably on drugs. The cop had been trained to recognize people on PCP.\nItsYouNotMe707: ya, PCP is not easily hidden. he wasnt buttnaked so for someone on pcp he was handling himself quite well. \njpe77: Well, except for hallucinating that his car was about to blow up and stopping it in the middle of a highway to escape it.\nItsYouNotMe707: well hey thats the brakes, if he wasnt on pcp hed probably still be alive. if the cops were properly trained on the use of lethal force he would still be alive, if miss scaredy pants had a better temperament for a dangerous job he could still be alive.. too many ifs, and its all over now. just a shame. \njpe77: Id give it a 75% chance at this point she isnt convicted.\nItsYouNotMe707: yea theyll take their sweet ass time and 2 years from now when no one gives a fuck anymore theyll let her off \nBoshasaurus_Rex: Can you link those 9-11 calls? This is the first Ive heard of them.\njpe77: One of em:Caller states I think hes smoking something.\nItsYouNotMe707: this is the truth. does it take a little of the stingray that the unarmed man was on mid altering drugs? maybe a little, but that is irrelevant. there is no death penalty for intoxication. these cops are trigger happy and need to be properly trained and evaluated before being set loose on the street with a weapon. he was not a lethal threat, he should be in rehab not a coffin. \nFortHouston: That is not a legal reason to arbitrarily shoot and kill somebody.\njpe77: Good thing no one said it was.\nGoCubsGo2007: Agreed. This is simply information about the case being made public. People want transparency with departments. Transparency works both for and against both parties involved. \nEbolaMan21: Dutertes calling, he wants his drug policy back!\nQuoth_the_jackdaw: God, I pray we never end up with a bombastic ass clown like that as our president. Could you imagine the embarrassment?\ntristanfinn: Iran hangs drug users - in the US the police shoot them dead in the street.  \nQuoth_the_jackdaw: Just like the Philippines!\nhash12341234: This makes him twice as innocent.\n',

Colonials didnt wash their hands, know anything about disease or sicknesses but somehow knew you could infect blankets and kill Indians with them.\nUintahwolf: Years ago , before gun-powder came to Europe, we were flinging bodies into forts and castles while they were under siege, because we knew all the rotting corpses would make them sick, and weak. We would even drop bodies into wells to poison the water supply . Do you really believe that hundreds of years later , man kind still hadnt figured out that they could transmit diseases in various ways? \ntrexofwanting: Hes half-right. Sure, we understood cause and effect, but we didnt understand the . When Columbus showed up in Central America we  hadnt figured it out and not only did lots and lots of Mesoamericans die, Of course, when we did, we toootally biological warfare-ed the Natives with smallpox. It was accidental at the beginning and deliberate by the end. Like I said, half-right. \nMobilebutts: Just google Indian blanket myth.  I learned the blanket story was a urban legend in high school.  Its not that controversial. \nDoctor_Sportello: who the fuck told you that?\ntitanroi385: Those guys were real dickheads. \nlocalbizdude: What exactly are they protesting? Dont the developers own the land? Or not?\nbybloshex: Yes. Its private land owned by the developer.\nlocalbizdude: So, why are they protesting?\ndagbiker: Because they are saying that a spill could harm their lands.\nbybloshex: According to their actual written suit... They dont even know. Theres no mention of possible pollution. They mention objects of historical significance but refused to cooperate with consultants on avoiding them.\neviltwink: theres absolutely possible pollution. the pipeline is set to go underneath cannonball river and has to somehow pass lake oahe.  thats why obama halted construction within 20 miles of these sites. didnt stick tho... check out all of the cases of pipeline ruptures/malfunctions even just in the past year or two. its a serious concern.\nbybloshex: The natives have an actual written suit against the pipeline. Possible pollution is not mentioned. It isnt a subject of debate.\njpe77: Funny theyre not suing over that, isnt it?\nMobilebutts: Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil.  No debate\nmitchb6: There have been many pipeline spills in the US this year alone and it is a very real concern for these people. It may be the safest way but it might not be safe enough to a people who have been screwed over for decades by companies and the government.\nMobilebutts: There have been many truck and train spills too.  Pipelines are the safest way possible.  And they where not concerned about pollution when the pipeline was going through their land and they where gonna get paid.  Only when the company decided to put it next to an existing pipeline did they start protesting.  They are pawns being led by rich assholes who wanted too much and the company said fuck you and moved it off their land.\nGibsonLP86: lets build it right next to your house then, and see how you like it.\nBoshasaurus_Rex: Truck and train spills are usually tiny compared to pipelines. There are more, but the amount of oil spilled is less.\npyrespirit: Define safest.\nMobilebutts: Safer than any other form of transportation of oil.  Not that hard of a concept\nMobilebutts: The pipe was originally gonna go through their land and they where gonna get paid.  But they wanted too much so the company decided just to put the pipe next to the old already built pipeline.These protesters are nothing but pawns for greedy fucks who are mad they are not getting paid.\nprismjism: Nope, the pipe was originally going to go through Bismark. But it was moved over concerns about Bismarks water supply.\neviltwink: ok well first lets acknowledge that the whole idea of private land owned by anybody on the land the US occupies was initiated through the attempted genocide of the indigenous peoples already here. Pipelines are busting all over the place (read the news), leaving a huge environmental mess behind them. If this pipeline were to rupture or malfunction at any point, the entire water supply its running thru would be contaminated.  THEY ARE PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE CLEAN WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT.  Regardless of what company was able to purchase this land that was originally STOLEN from these tribes, Indians from all over the country are coming together in a movement thats protesting the disrespect and abuse of indigenous peoples and land by the US government and private companies. NO ONE OWNS THE LAND.\nMobilebutts: The pipeline is going right next to another pipeline.  They only started protesting when the company took the plans off their land and now they are not gonna get paid.\nawesomemofo75: They lost. It sucks, but they were conquered\nprismjism: And the treaties with our government mean less than the paper they were printed on.\njpe77: Guess so. Maybe we shouldnt pay them billions of dollars for that land, then.\nGETOUTOFMEDEMON: I thought the protesters got their way after the video of them being attacked with dogs surfaced? \nmitchb6: They halted it for a few weeks but construction has resumed\nIz-kan-reddit: And then they lost it after the picture of the bitten girl was proven to be of a girl that was bitten by a family dog in Texas.\nwtfIhateTrumpnow: Just saying, If I dont get my oil or gas prices go up, I hope the police are taking volunteers. \n(1 child): \nzxcvbnqwertyasfdgh: If you surround my car, prevent me from leaving, and try to gain entry to my car to get to me then there is a 100% chance that I will drive through the aggressors to safety. Please practice critical thinking skills.\n',

 'desc': u'oxfordcircumstances: Congress passed the bill.  Obama signed it.  Revenue bills originate in the House.\nlinussy: And Reddit give Republican Congress credit? Ha.\nNebulious: Did some checking and  is indeed sponsored by Repulicans.\nithinkitsbeertime: From your link it passed the Senate unanimously and the house 415-1 with 22 members too busy hitting on interns.  We did it USA!  We got bipartisan support for something.\nzoells: Who voted against? \nMcMagic:  I wonder what his opposition was?Edit: I actually agree with his justification, and see this as political pandering to special interests. My question wasnt so much lol whats this guys problem but rather I wonder what his particular reasoning was. However, I can also see the argument that many professional athletes forgo a portion of their regular professional competitions in order to attend the Olympics and Olympic trials (NFL, NHL, PL athletes). Since many people consider competing in the Olympics as a patriotic activity, it could be seen as a service to the country for which they should not be taxed. Thus the knee-jerk positive response most people have to this bill.The thing is: this isnt a tax on the value of the award metals, this is a tax on the bonuses that go along with them. Those are winnings, and really should be taxed as winnings, as we are all equal under the law. Or at least were supposed to be.\nSumthingStupid: You shouldnt avoid taxes because you are good at a sport maybe? Its near political suicide to oppose this,\nThink Representative Bob loves America? Well hes trying to make team USA surrender their hard won gold from the Olympics!Edit. The US winners get a cash prize from the US sports federation. Thats whats being taxed\nHagbardCelineHere: I posted it above but wanted you to see it as well. . Hes not wrong. \nDongsquad420BlazeIt: Hes not wrong, stuff like this is why the tax code is 9001 pages long. Still, no one wants to look like a dick by taxing Americas heroes (or whatever). I appreciate that he stood by his convictions, even if hes going to be made out to be the biggest asshole in the country.\njsct: Hes going to be made out to be an asshole for not falling for a pile of shit wrapped in the flag.  People complain when someone like Trump gets $1 Billion worth of exemption, but this is how it starts - with some feel-good deduction to help those poor struggling members of group X.  Why shouldnt you get to deduct loan interest?  Why shouldnt you get to deduct the money you spend building residences for people?  Does Trump have less of a right to use the same exemptions that everyone else is offered?\nanti_dan: The reason for the bill is because of the United States unique extra-territorial tax scheme. If Astronauts, teachers, and Nobel prize winners earn income in another country I would like to see them get similar treatment. \nHot4_TeaCha: If Im on the international space station but my paycheck is signed out of NASAs headquarters where am I earning my money?\nalso_HIM: This has nothing to do with extraterritorial taxes. The prize money given to winners in the US is given in the US, by a US nonprofit (the USOC). There is no prize money given by the Olympics (IOC), so each country is left to reward their athletes (or not) on their own. \nZagubadu: Yea but like others are saying here its not the gold medal being taxed but the reward money.Well people win the lottery and have to pay taxes soooo idk....People play professional sports for years and have multi-million dollar careers they have to pay taxes.....What exactly is different about the olympics?\nWebo_: Olympians arent necessarily rich sportsmen with huge sponsorship deals. Lots of them are ordinary folk who go back to very ordinary jobs. Only the very high profile Olympians can make a career out of it.\nVROF: Plenty of not rich people earn performance bonuses at their jobs that are taxed\npasswordsarehard_3: Neither are scientists but I dont see them being exempt for the Nobel winnings. \ni_sigh_less: Anecdotal evidence backs that up, since there are only about four current olympians I can name, out of what I assume to be thousands.\ninversedwnvte: I think theoretically, the principle behind the argument, stands; despite the fact that only very high profile olympians make a real monetary living off sponsorships.Olympic money just isnt lucrative enough to be politically worthwhile to tax. IMO the glory and history behind olympics records have historical value that cannot be changed once it is made; excluding incidents of doping becoming a thing to invalidate results. \nAtomicFlx: Funny, a lot of poor people still pay taxes, why should Olympians be any different? \nMarcusRatz: No, whats the difference between an Olympic athlete with a low paying job, not having to pay tax on his winnings, and a person with a low paying job that does have to pay tax on his winnings from any other sporting competitions?\nCardMechanic: Fuck. Im not rich either. Id rather my boss pay me monetary rewards than a salary if I can avoid being taxed on it. \nbankerman: So theyll be taxed in a lower bracket then. \nmsabre7: Im not rich and I have to pay the same tax as anyone else on capital gains. \nApatheticAbsurdist: I mean if an Olympian only made $10k from winning a medal (and made nothing else) they wouldnt be taxed on that anyway, right (below the minimum income requirement). But if an Olympian makes $50k from work, $40k in medal awards, and $100k in endorsements, shouldnt they pay taxes on that medal. And if an olympian only make $30k in a year including the medal, theyd be in a lower tax bracket so while theyd pay some tax, they wouldnt pay as much as the person above.Is not what we had a fair system already?\nTurkalator: The amateur argument comes in to play. Most Olympians have very little earning potential related to their given event. Im not sure if I agree with this viewpoint, but I think thats where a lot of folks are coming from.\nFlamesmcgee: I dont think it should really matter how much you earn - tax is the sort of thing that, in theory, should inconvenience everyone equally.That means it applies to the rich, but it also means it applies to the poor.It doesnt matter if youre elderly, or a young college graduate; tax is equal for everyone.\nTheBaronOfTheNorth: After a Google search they get $25,000 per gold medal.  They arent skipping out on much considering how much the famous ones already pay through having high wages.  This will definitely help out those who win a medal and wont be getting paid anything substantial through endorsements and/or dont have a professional league for their sport of choice.  \nScoobyDoNot: Technically the winners do not get a cash prize with their medal.For winning a gold medal, the US sports federations awards $25,000 to the winner. The medal itself is worth around $600.\nSumthingStupid: Thats what I mean, Ill rephrase.\nIAmTheGov: Republicans and democrats: Simplify the tax code!  Republicans and democrats: just added another exemption/paragraph of regs to tax code.\nGhostOfCardozo: Hey now, dont fuck with the ratings.\nHagbardCelineHere: . Hes not wrong. \njpe77: Carving out exceptions for special interests is bad policy.\nImprobableIT: Edit: I stand corrected. It seems they are within their authority to do so.\u201cIt makes an unpaid-for carve out, is most likely to benefit the richest athletes and further complicates an already complex tax code,\u201d Himes, a Democrat who represents Connecticut\u2019s Fourth DistrictI tend to agree with him. Im not sure what constitutional authority congress had to exclude this group from being taxed on these particular earnings. Seems like the right way to do it would be a constitutional amendment but I am no scholar.Alternatively, they could have increased their pay enough to offset the taxes.\nsorasonline: Tax is one of their powers. They can write it how they want. It doesnt have to be smart.\nItinerantBanana: Problem with them increasing the payout to cover this is that they are the US olympic commission.  They are an independent org that are not comnected to the government.  Congress has no control over what the commission elects to award winners.\nTerry_Spargin: \nRemoteProvider: Bipartisan support is easy to get when your bill has no effect on 99.99% of the population and doesnt address a real issue.\nTh30r14n: Now lets pass a budget!Bwhahahahaha\ndelightfuldinosaur: Thanks  Rand\nsparta1170: Thanks  Republicans\nAdmiral_Akdov: But when things go south, make sure you blame the president.\nGuardian_Of_Reality: That is what they are there for.\nevebrah: It is typical for republicans to be behind tax cuts.\nBye-Stander: Seems silly, but I appreciate the clarification. The whole I must enforce the law concept seems to be a thing of the distant past. \nJmunnny: And Senator Marco Rubio a Republican sponsered it. \nNighthawk0973: Look, man  If were gonna give Obama shit for the bad shit the Republicans do, we mind as well give him props for the good shit too. \nthorscope: What things has he gotten shit for that the republicans caused?\nRockSta-holic: The only thing I can think of was when Obama and congress couldnt make up a budget. Congress would make the budget, Obama would veto. Seems more like they both needed to compromise but neither wanted to.\nmetrion: While not just Republicans fault,  when Congress overturned Obamas veto of the 9/11 lawsuit bill.\nredrubberpenguin: Not so much a Reddit blames him as much as a people blame him.\nEDGE515: TARP for one thing. Many blame him for blowing up the deficit when he first took office, but fail to remember that President Bush actually signed TARP into law shortly before leaving office. Also the stimulus package was a direct response to the collapsing economy left behind by Bush in order to prevent a depression but yet they insist on blaming him for blowing up the debt on that too.Oh, and the government shut down, which was actually a political gambit initiated by Ted Cruz in an extreme attempt to essentially force Congress to stop funding the Affordable care act. Also the credit rating drop that lowered Americas AAA bond rating due to said debacle.\nHulminak: This kind of feel good legislation is why our tax code is so complicated and full of loopholes.\nwayoverpaid: Yes.  Theres no one obvious bad rule but the crushing weight of exceptions gets to be too much to manage.People love to call things an X-tax as if X was being singled out.  The Olympic Victory Tax is just income tax.  The Tampon Tax is just a sales tax.By that logic here are some other taxes we could end:Eventually we could culminate in ending the protected minority tax -- AKA any tax paid by any protected minority for any reason.Yes, this is a strawman and a slippery slope fallacy all rolled together.  Im not literally saying that the logical end-point of tax loopholes is that well end up making certain races tax exempt.  Just saying that you can argue a tax-exemption for anything if you make it sound like something good is being specifically taxed.\nDongsquad420BlazeIt: What have babies ever done for me, anyways?\nYanqui-UXO: Without babies who would we test cosmetics on?\nTHEJAZZMUSIC: Ugly people. \nokmkz: Oh that would happen regardless\nwtfisflapdoodle: Did you know that the IRS has lobbied congress to give them the ability to calculate our taxes for us? I imagine HR Block and Quicken put a lot of money behind stopping that. \nwayoverpaid: I love the arguments too.  The IRS wont be incentived to give you the best possible discountMore like HR Block wouldnt be able to compete if the money they save you on deductions was less than what they charge.\nDaTwatWaffle: I mean... arent both true?\nInFearn0: Not really.  Most people do the standard deduction and import their W-2 info.  The first year or two the IRS calculates  your tax return, people will do it themselves and get the same results.  Then after that people will just approve the IRS generated one to get their refund early or do nothing and have the IRS one count when tax day comes.The IRS will prep your taxes plan always was going to allow people to submit a custom filing, the point was to cut down on how many people bothered to custom file (and it would be huge).\n1millionbucks: Yes. But I imagine the people that would hurt the most are the ones exploiting ridiculous loopholes in the tax code.That said, the IRS would probably fuck up the whole thing anyway.\nwayoverpaid: Well, if the IRS doesnt compute a good deal for you, then everyone will go you cant trust the IRS, they really try to rip you off which would generate even more ill will.  The goal of the IRS doing your taxes for you is so make paying taxes easy.  You log onto your site, enter some info, and it uses the knowledge it already has plus a few basic questions to give you a tax return, thus making taxes easier / less painful / less stressful.So I think the IRS does have an incentive to give you a good discount.  Maybe not to scrounge every penny, but they have to do at least as good as Turbo Tax. \nBigLurchForPresident: Im shocked that HR Block is still in business. They are tax preparers, not CPAs and have little to no experience and qualifications. They still charge you like they were adding an immense amount of value though.That being said, I wouldnt want the IRS to compute my tax because of privacy concerns. Its easy for the IRS to look at returns and determine that they are reasonable, but in order for them to determine our tax they would need nearly all of our financial information.\nampellang: Only if youre taking itemized deductions, which would likely be excluded anyway.  I would assume that their intent would be to auto-calculate for the standard deduction.\nInFearn0: My CPA father volunteers his time to help low income individuals prepare their taxes because maintaining the CPA license requires pro bono hours.He also happens to be retired and I think he does it to have an excuse to get out of the house.Edit: he might be substituting his volunteer hours for the 4 hours of ethics.\nBigLurchForPresident: I wonder if its the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA). Ive volunteered for them the last 2 years. Anyone who makes less than $52k, is elderly, or has a disability can stop by during tax season to have them done for free. Really great program thats actually run by the IRS that very few people seem to know about.\nslccsoccer28: I think thats how a lot of other countries do it.\njiggy68: The IRS makes errors on fully completed tax returns given to them all the time.  How many mistakes do you think theyd make if they had to actually make the returns?  Theyre understaffed, overburdened and to think they could do the taxes of everyone in the country is specious at best.\nwtfisflapdoodle: Imagine if the arm of government meant to collect revenue had a proper budget. \ncommandercool86: What would take less time, them doing the taxes, or them having to double check that the taxes submitted were done correctly? Me thinks the former.\nkingssman: just another if you fit within this category, you get to X kind of like how my tax form asks me if Im a farmer or railroad worker...  Can I get legislation passed with a fancy checkbox indicating that my income comes from a snowflake industry that makes me different from 80% of all other sources of income even though technically work is work and income is income?\n(23 children): \nallanbc: Its ridiculous how people are going after him for using the tax rules completely as intended in this case. Theres so much legitimately terrible shit hes done that you could literally fill every single news report with it, at least, you could if that hadnt already been done.\nBeor_The_Old: Not really. The reason presidents always release their taxes is to show they they didnt abuse loopholes that most people argue should be fixed. Thats why he didnt release them. He knew people would be rightly angry. Id expect it from a CEO, but he isnt running to be the CEO of a country. Paying taxes is seen as patriotic and why would you want to look unpatriotic?? I get that it was a smart business move but for a politician its a bad move.\nViklove: What gave you that idea?\njsct: Whats the difference between abusing a loophole and using it as intended?  Is there a dollar amount on either the exemption or income where you can no longer use it?  If so, why isnt that written into the law?\nbuckingbronco1: Depends on how little you know about corporate taxation or the tax code in general.\nAchack: As if most presidents with this plan cant hide the money they want to keep.  Its such a BS strategy to think paperwork on a millionaire is going to prove a point.  Both Hillary and Trump need a bulldozer to move their money around, they can afford to hide the money they want to hide.  Neither one of them has any reason to change that.\nje35801: Fuck that.  Not taking advantage of the loopholes would be dumb.  And keep saying paying taxes makes you a patriot.  People dont like taxes unless they arent paying them. your not going to convince anyone that they are unpatriotic because they take advantage of legal deductions no matter how much you repeated that stupid, bullshit line.\npostonrddt: Exactly, feel good legislation to pander with. Quite frankly I dont think most give two hoots now months after the Olympics. Judging by the defense of Lochte and other Olympic stuff representatives were probably bombarded by friends of Olympians with advocacy of this bill. \ncanteloupy: This is bullshit because basically it just treats some types of income from work differently from others. Why is this any different from say a signing bonus or capital gains?\ndeclension: Number of people affected?  Ability to abuse it?\npostonrddt: Its not. Thats why its feel good legislation only. A professional politician gets to tell themselves they are patriotic. I bet much of the same crowd doesnt even know or care GE has paid little or no taxes and screamed when they found out Trump paid no taxes on a loss.\nWhy_the_hate_: If they sign with brands then they have to still pay taxes on that income I believe.\ndoormatt26: Because its competing for your nation by athletes in sports that typically are paid relatively little for non-olympic competition. Its a small gesture of extra appreciation for something that brings an immense amount of pride to many in the country. And like any tax benefit - from child credits to mortgage deductions - its designed to incentivise a behavior that Congress things is beneficial to the country as a whole in some way. \nrh1n0man: There is a much simpler way to do this, increase the gold medal prize from $25k to something higher. Then tax that amount just like you would for all other income.\ndoormatt26: Sure thats easier for the tax code, but I got bad news for you if you always want Congress to pick the least complex option. It accomplishes the same goal, so no biggie overall. \nrh1n0man: By making it non-taxable income there is a much greater benefit to those who are otherwise successful and in a higher tax bracket. For the income poor athletes it amounts to about $2,500 extra take home per gold. For rich athletes with tons of endorsements, it is $10,000 extra. So no, it is not the same; It is regressive, arbitrary, and inflexible.\nstarwarsfan48: About a year ago, the federal tax code was already over 74,600 pages long. Its almost incomprehensible to imagine something of that size.\nw-4-wumbo: For context, War and Peace is only 1,225 pages long (in the first published edition)\nSpidersinmypants: They just created another loophole.  We now have the winning Olympic medal loophole.  Presumably if you win a prize at some other federation competition, you still pay the tax.\nHelpImSoVeryDiseased: Its the other way around. The 1986 code is full of pretty plain language, and then people started thinking up clever loopholes within the structure of the law. To close the loopholes, the law became more and more complicated.For example, youre allowed to deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses. Seems simple enough, but due to people gaming the system the definition of what exactly ordinary and necessary is has changed over the years. What could have just been one paragraph has turned into hundreds if not thousands of pages of case law. A good rule of thumb is that if this is a necessary expense that would be made in most similar businesses, you can take it. But when you have something as general as Justice Stewarts I know it when I see it definition of pornography in the code, taxpayers will make loopholes. \nHapticSloughton: Next up: Accountants getting Nike, Reebok, etc. to give endorsement deals to athletes as prizes.\nreven80: The money has to come from the US Olympic committee and the winner has to has an AGI less than $1M.\nLagT_T: Even with less than 1M AGI thats a lot of attack speed and armor.\nRagnalypse: Yeah, only Drow really breaks 1M AGI anyway.\nMwahahahahahaha:  is leaking\nObamaDontCare0: I would morph some more strength, to be honest.\ndannycalamity: He might not be able to - depends how much is base and how much is bonus. 1+1000000 cant be reduced any more.\nchuckymcgee: Well, if you dont have all of these endorsement deals then your AGI can be less than $1M pretty easily!\nthiney49: I think thats the point. If youre rolling in cash, youre still taxed. If not, enjoy your metal tax free. \nThebestguyever11: tax free megadeth for all poor metal heads!\nQlanger: I was thinking this will go badly like so many other feel good tax breaks when corps and tax attorneys get involved.At least there is a limit of a million.   \nWingerRules: In addition to the million limit, the bill limits it to only competitions for the olympics. I think it also says only for money given out by the olympic committee, but not sure the standard way its read legally. Either way, olympians generally compete only once or twice, few olympic athletes get significant endorsement awards, and its specifically restricted olympic games. The pool of people benefiting from it at any one time is going to be relatively small.\nEndless_Vanity: Holy shit, Im in the wrong field of work.\njsct: Another silly tax loophole based on feel-good legislation.  If we dont want to tax olympic winners, why should we tax those that win the Nobel or Fields prize after working for it for their entire careers, not just the first 2-3 decades of their life!  Every 4 years there are roughly 1600 olympic medals, but only 24 Nobels (if all are awarded - they often arent) and only 1 Fields!  Tell me which is the bigger achievement.\nRonniePastrami: Yeah dude but smart stuff is gay\nMoonStache: Fucking nerds.\nSJSragequit: an olympic gold medal is only 25k where as a nobel prize is over a million\n-JesusChrysler: All the more reason to exempt Nobel prize winners.  Why should they have to pay $300K in taxes for winning a elite global prize, especially if we dont make an Olympic ribbon dancer pay $5K for their prize medal?\ncuestbeats: More like 400k\nBluepass11: They shouldnt either \nvioletnap: I wish working hard and making money at ones job was considered a victory so I could get my taxes lowered. \noverzealous_dentist: The cost would be quite large - multiply your tax break across everyone in your class. The cost of this, comparatively, is infinitesimal.\nChonn: Now if the government handled tax income more responsibly... \nSyno101: What an achievement.  Now how about fixing my roads.\nmrnonamex: Thats your mayors job\nChiliad3: Marco Rubio originally sponsored this bill. Obama only signed it because its his job to either sign or veto it.By the way, if you do a Google News search for Rubio right now, the top 100 stories are about his support of Donald Trump, Rubios remarks on Hurricane Matthew, his tribute to the late Jose Fernandez, and 97 other unrelated things.\nMalphael: This is awful tax policy. Everyone should be against things like this.Theres nothing special about winning a cash prize or being an athlete that should exempt you from paying taxes on that award.Income is any undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion. Glenshaw Glass.If I win $25,000 on a scratch off lottery ticket, why do I have to pay taxes, but the Olympian doesnt?Likewise, if I play sportsball for a living and make $500,000 a year, why am I taxed but the Olympian sportsball player isnt taxed on their award for playing sportsball?Theres simply no good reason for treating taxpayers differently in this manner. \nDPlaintiff: I agree wholeheartedly - since when does being an Olympic athlete mean you dont benefit from public spending. \nMalphael: This is purely a politically motivated exemption. Its a small drop in the bucket for the budget, but I mean, gosh darn it those brave, patriotic Olympians just deserve it and its terrible that the mean ol IRS enforces the US tax code, so lets give them a special exemption because theyre special heroes and I can campaign on this issue.And this is how you smother your tax code with a pillow in the night boys and girls. Inch by precious inch.\npeted1884: We fund our government by taxing income.  Being paid for sports achievements seem like income to me.  Why would this be treated differently than my income?  If I declare my daily grind a sport does that make me tax exempt?\ntherestimeforklax: Fucking bullshit.  Stop this loophole nonsense!  Our tax system is already too complicated.  People are taxed on income.  Period.  Doesnt matter how they got it.  Our taxes are way too high in every sense.  America has the highest total tax rate in the world and we get nothing for it.  If you take all the payroll, corporate, state and federal income, property, sales, cap. gains, etc etc etc, its the highest in the world.  The US has the highest corporate tax rate so our companies dont bring their profits back and we agree to fair trade deals when the countries we agree with consistently adjust their domestic tax systems to make American imports more expensive and remain protectionist even without the straight tariff so we cant compete.  I dont understand why people would want taxes to go up for anyone, its not like youre going to benefit from the extra revenue the gov siphons off.  \nSports_Shorts: US tax rates vary a lot based on location and personal circumstance (sorry California), but personal taxes paid by individuals are nothing especially high. The corporate tax does probably need to reworked to be lower and territorially based though. This is getting to be a pretty consensus opinion recently.\nampellang: If the company is publicly traded, so its owners are everywhere, and theyre outsourcing their labor force, AND we let them get away without paying taxes, what exactly is it that makes them our company?  A mailing address in Delaware?\nTriggered_SJW: When did writing and getting bills through congress become part of the presidents activities?\nglap1922: If I like it,  side is responsible. If I dont like it, the  side is responsible.For example, a bill passes that people like means the Democrats give credit to Obama and Republicans give credit to congress. If you they dont like the just reverse who caused it.Its pretty simple stuff really. Easy way to remember it is, The people who dont believe the same stuff as me are evil, trying to destroy the country, and couldnt possibly do something good. If they do something good and my side cant get the credit, it was an accident or they have sneaky motives that we can only speculate on, and dont worry, we will speculate and present those speculations as fact.\ncazique: No kidding, I hate this new tax loophole, but the blame should be shared among many people.\ncaverunner17: I agree with this. What most people dont realize is that the majority of Olympians arent some rich super-star like Phelps or Usain Bolt. Many of them, especially in smaller, less popular sports, are scraping by. Their contracts could be something as small as free gear or small sponsorship amounts to having a coach paid for and housing assistance, etc. In reality, the United States receives positive exposure (unless youre Ryan Lochte) from medalists. The 46 gold medals ($1,150,000 in cash prizes) + the rest of the Silver and Bronze medals (lets say $700,000) that the US Olympians won in 2016 would only attribute to probably $500k of tax revenue. By allowing the athletes to not be taxed, they are essentially receiving a few thousand dollar gift for representing their country.All in all, its not really a huge amount of money were talking about here, but could make a significant impact in the medal recipients lives. \nwhatisupdoge: Im not some rich super-star either.. yet my income is still taxed.\ncaverunner17: From the moment they step off the plane during the Olympics, they are wearing some type of gear that says USA, Red White and Blue or the US flag on it. Id say look at it as more of a small payment for being a walking billboard for the United States for two weeks. \ndaveb25: For tax-free income, this will be \nAshley250: What does the US need to advertise for?\naerovistae: Any idea how much tourism income is worth to a countrys economy?United States makes $200 billion+ per year off it.\nHapticSloughton: Where should we go on vacation, my non-American spouse?Let us go to a country that has won many Olympic medals, my non-American spouse!Of course! Why did I not think of that?It must be all the family leave time and socialized healthcare.\nOmegamanthethird: I cant tell if this is sarcasm or not. But you could apply the same rationale to most commercials.I think Ill buy that vehicle in the Matthew McConaughey commercial.The point is to get the product in peoples mind with a positive image. \naerovistae: Funny, but no, its never one single thing like that-- its an agglomeration of exposures in a million different contexts that insinuates the idea into ones mind. The olympics are just one among many.\nSourSenior: The above is an example of a person that is receptive to subliminal advertising and brand awareness initiatives.\nAirway: Im guessing its not that direct.A country being associated with good things (the best athletes, in this case) is never bad.\nYourWaterloo: Couldnt then you argue that anyone who is adding to the countrys economy should be tax-exempt? Its silly, lots of people serve their country and still have to pay taxes, theres no good reasons why Olympians should be exempt. \nSCREW-IT: Being the greatest\nGuardian_Of_Reality: Everyone already knows that though. \nGumAcacia: everyone drinks coca cola too and they still have advertisements\nGr8NonSequitur: Doesnt hurt to remind them. \nfancyhatman18: I wear shit that says USA when I work and I still pay tax.\nzorbiburst: I wear shirts with American flags on them all the time. Thanks for nothing, Obama.\njoequin: Members of the US military have their income taxed.\nShitpostbotmk2: The money was just being taxed as income.   The media was in an absolute frenzy talking about the 40% tax and how it hurt struggling athletes, but only the really successful athletes paid 40%. The ones struggling to get by only paid 10-15%, no one seemed to want to mention that and you certainly didnt factor it in when coming up with $500k.  Changing the tax code benefits the super wealthy way more than it helps the little guy. Its like the Government giving a quarter million back to Phelps so they can pat themselves on the back for letting Joe Shmolympian take home an extra 1k.   They would have done so much better to not fuck with the tax code and just change the budget to direct an amount equivalent to the tax proceeds back to the low income athletes.\nwillthesane: this contributes to tax code bloat, which causes income taxes to be more expensive to file.\nCarelessChemicals: No, this is yet another ridiculous complication to the tax code.  The tax code needs to be simple, not full of complexities and loopholes.\nmezzrricki: How about the USOC pays taxes for our victors like some pro teams do for championship rings for employees. Prevent additional tax code complexity. If the govt wants to give this 500k to the athletes, then provide additional funding to the USOC.\nMongoloidMormon: If thats your reason, you should apply it equally to all citizens. Its not a huge amount of money, so why dont we give the same tax break to every American. It could make a significant impact on their lives.\ncazique: Yeah, but everyone else works for their money, too. These athletes get to travel the world doing what they love also get a tax holiday while I pay more? No thanks!\nnuck_nuck: Does that make a difference?  I can be an amateur in any number of things for side income.  Why do obscure sports players get a free ride in your book? \nSJSragequit: to add on to the athletes in less popular sport not making very much money, a fair amount of them are university athletes who cant take sponsorship deals if they want to be ncaa eligible. so this is most likely there only income for the 4-5 years in university \nmaroonmonday: I feel like the article is missing an important fact, like what determines if an athlete like Phelps can still be taxed? I would assume it is based on if you win over a certain amount of money, but it would be nice if they took the time to tell us the details.\njay_bro:  Sorry about that I agree it was way too vague.\nd3jake: Obama didnt end the tax. Congress passed a bill that he signed that ends the tax.\ngw2master: This is the worst kind of political pandering.  On all sides.\njaymz668: Why should they be exempt from taxation from their pursuits? edit to add:\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee awards cash prizes to medalists, ranging from $25,000 for gold to $10,000 for bronze\ndrakesylvan: I dont agree with not taxing the money paid by the government to them for winning, that is income. I do agree that the actual metals should not be taxed though on the material costs. \nIz-kan-reddit: Yeah, but thats less than you think. Gold medals are 92% silver. Evn the silver medals arent 100% silver.\ndrakesylvan: I know, I think the value of the metal is the only exemption here. The prize money should be taxed like any other contests winnings. They will do the withholding and at the end of the year theyll do their taxes and if theyre in a certain low bracket they get the majority of that withholding back. \nTerribleEngineer: These bull shit ammendments are qhat make the tax code a joke. Tax active employment income all the same. Capital gains equal. And all rentier type income the same. Three types of income... get rid of the thousands of special clauses and preferred sources... its ridiculous and basically a full employment scheme for accountants.\ndrakesylvan: Damn right. This another example of terrible legislation that makes our tax code into the bloated mess it is today. \nOdkin: Disclaimer: Republicans sponsored this bill so I am not blaming Obama, but his kind of thing annoys me. Yeah, its nice they dont get taxed. But itd be nice if I didnt get taxed, either.  Itd be nice if a guy who went overseas to win a contract for a American workers didnt get taxed. Itd be nice if military members didnt get taxed. But itd be NICER if our public servants would quit wasting time carving out meaningless exemptions and symbolic gestures, and make a simple tax code that treated everyone the same.\nchaseizwright: Wow! Such big news out of DC! A law that will effect literally a couple dozen Americans once every 4 years! This needs to be on the front page of every news outlet! /s\nrips10: I say the rich need to pay their fair share.  Close the Olympics loophole!\nCrazyUSMarine: Ive worked my ass off my entire life. How is it right they keep their money, and I cant keep mine if I get a bonus?\ndrcalmeacham: Great. Now stop taxing other Americans earnings, as well.\nvwboyaf1: While military members still pay taxes.  Weird.\nElijahMatthew344: This title is misleading. Its not like Obama himself unilaterally ended the tax; thats not how our government works. It should read, Obama signs bill ending Olympic victory tax. Congress writes and passes (or rejects) legislation - the president signs or vetoes said legislation.This gives a false impression to readers that Obama came up with the idea, wrote a law, then implemented it on his own. That is incorrect.\ntoml3030: Okay, so if I set up a my own olympics committee and pay myself in medals the government isnt going to tax me, right?  Or does certain private organization get treated differently than others?\nBoco: Except you cant because the USOC isnt just any private organization. Its a federally chartered nonprofit thats exclusively authorized to use and license Olympics related trademarks in the US.\npargmegarg: It cant be any olympics committee. It has to be the IOC. So unless you have a time machine, youre SoL.\nreven80: Why not try it out and let us all know.\npunt_the_dog_0: the fuck are you even talking about? sure, you can pay yourself in medals, and the government wont tax you.just like you can  to stand in your own bedroom twiddling your thumbs all night, and the government wont tax you.your ability to construct coherent and relevant analogies is absolutely abysmal.\nnullstring: Those who own their own corporations must pay income tax when on the salary that they executively pay themselves.He is suggesting one could form an Olympic organization to award medals in lieu of salary and skip the income tax.(But of course this isnt how the law works).\nMojotothemax: The tax rescinded by the law eliminates the tax on medals or most other rewards given to Olympians, including monetary prizes, but taxes will remain on high-profile Olympians like Michael Phelps.  If you do set up your own olympic committee and give the rewards to yourself, then unless that committee has outside revenue or you attract a large amount of media attention, you are essentially giving money you already own back to yourself.\nEndless_Vanity: Those good old loopholes just opened up for everyone with a little knowledge.\n______5: Except they didnt for people with actual knowledge who dont feel like paying the IRS massive fines for tax evasion.  \nsweatyyetsalty: Just what the tax code needed, more exemptions.  Fucking bullshit.  Make a tax rule that isnt an exemption for something specific!  This type of action makes the tax code even more cumbersome.We need to vote these ass clowns out or one day something like a Trump will win office.\nbruno92: And yet Nobel prizes are still taxed. #murica\nruns_in_the_jeans: wait..so they get a tax break and I dont? \ndjdanlib: Thats cool. What about employee tuition benefits, which are taxed at  such insanely high rates that you cant really afford the free tuition?\ninternet_poster: You mean the marginal tax rate of the individual?\nFireAdamSilver: Reddit loves loves loves taxes, lets see how this plays out.\nIz-kan-reddit: For all of you Fair Tax supporters, this wouldnt be happening.\nSpidersinmypants: Well the idea would be that there are no loopholes.  Congress just created yet another loophole.  In 20 years when everyone forgets about why this was passed, people will be bitching about athletes avoiding taxes by using this loophole.\nMalphael: This isnt a loophole. A loophole is when you use a defect in a law to accomplish something that the law was not intended to do.This law is working as intended. Thus, not a loophole. (yet)\nwillthesane: this is stupid, its a waste of time. not that I dont want to celebrate the wins, but the cost in having another law on the IRS tax code, is greater than the cost of the comparatably small number of athletes this affects.\nguitarworms: So, does this count as Obama cutting taxes? *sarcasm\nLetsPlayThisBro: Thank you for dedicating your life to make American athletics look great in the eyes of the world, now pay your taxes and get your shine box!\ngetoffmylawnplease: Is increasing my wage and being a productive society member not a victory? \nBabybleu42: Phelps is probably like damn a little late Obama!\nMalphael: Phelps wouldnt have been able to use it anyway. If you make more than a million dollars, you are cut off from taking advantage of it.\ntrexreturns: This kind of thing is what describes the differences in the developed and developing countries. Here in India, an olympic medalist not only has to not worry about victory taxes but is even literally showered with monetory rewards by various political parties and other avenues for bringing fame to the country. This kind of tax would be unthinkable here. But then again this only happens once you have won the accolade. Before that, during prep, you are mostly on your own with no support from the govt of any sort.  \n',

 'desc': u'jambears: This just in. Living in Kansas marginally more bearable. \nFluffyBunnyHugs: Needs more opiates to dull the senses. \nzzyzxzy: The cheapest substitute is religion, and they have that in spades!\nbeartheminus: Cheapest? Clearly you ditch before the collection plate goes round. \ncyrusm: Thats for collections?  Oh... so I shouldnt have been using it to break 20s for all those years? \nSalsa_Johnny: Two tens and a five to the twenty?\nalbitzian: break twenties?   shiiiiiit, take twenties.   The trick is going with a small group...preferably five friends....THEN you all sit together and the dude in the middle gets sticky finger duty, every one else puts a dollar or 2 in and nobody notices the hundred coming out.  Best way for the crew to buy brunch on a sunday.  \nbeartheminus: Costanza: why would you ever buy an umbrella? They give them away at the front of restaurants\nSeinfeld: those are peoples....\nGreySkale42: In church to self:       \nrandomusername023: Yeah but the popular brand doesnt actually require anything really substantial, like introspection. So in a way its very cheap and very easy!\nJubeltheBear: Actually... considering you have your base tithe: 10% of whatever you earn (gross mind you), then whatever the pastor is demanding for his discretions (trips to Africa, a new car, new deck for his house, his mistress). Also consider time you spend in the church doing volunteer activities (choir rehearsals, trip chaperoning, diaconate services etc.) which are time consuming (time is money). When you put all that bullshit together: I actually think Meth is cheaper...\nbazooka_matt: This has been the call of KS police, DAs and others who profit from drug policing, seizure, and civil forfeiture for sometime. This is not a call against pot, it a boy crying wolf to get more money for his state from the feds.  Bloat the states DEA and police, make jobs and by toys nothing else.\nnotevenapro: I bet the AG requests more funding to fight evil marijuana.\nCallooh_Calais: Good. Hopefully Kansas becomes flooded with so much cheap Colorado pot, theyre forced to legalise it under the weight of all the demand for unaffordable increased policing.It could happen in even the deepest, reddest states. Alaska long ago legalised pot for that being one of the reasons (cheap pot from Canada), and Arizona has recreational on the ballot this year.Its a strange time to be alive, anything could happen.\ngrungebot5000: and its winning in the Arizona polls too, despite fierce opposition\nMaxidaz: Im in Massachusetts where its also on the ballot. Was in the dmv and they had a book with all the info on each question. The no arguments official stance was basically what youd expect from satire about anti drug campaigns. Dispensaries will pop up near preschools and playgrounds towns and cities will have no control over marijuana shops appearing in their townsBecause we have so much control over the drug dealers weve got now.\nsocsa: Oh no!  If only there was some way we could prevent children from buying cannabis.  Like some kind of limitation on who can purchase it based on how many times they have witnessed the earth rotate around the sun?  We could like, assign them some sort of identification card which officially validates such a restriction.  Eh, seems complicated.  We should probably just let free markets figure it out.    \nMaxidaz: I really dont get that one at all. Like some four year old is gonna walk in and go hey man you got some of that grand daddy purp?\nrruedas: But if its visible in the neighborhood, parents might actually have to explain what pot is to their stupid children, and everyone knows that being aware of a thing is the first step to becoming the thing. Thats why 100% of kids choose to become gay when they find out about gay marriage.\nIm-Currently-Working: Can confirm, I once saw a dispensary, and now I am pot.\nDrArsone: Bro when I was with my last girl her four year old blazed mad trees like it was nothing. Anytime Id go to the store hed want some swishas to roll with. That fam was crazy\nfunky_duck: People have no problem driving their kids past liquor stores and bars, pop culture is inundated with booze ads and its fine but cannabis?I just want to slap all these people in face and scream Why is this different?!\nbrokendownandbusted: Its way more profitable for them to keep it illegal (but we know that). Ive heard of whole commercial fishing boats being seized in the gulf coast because the guys had some sterilized cannabis seeds (bird seed) on his ship.Theyll use any excuse to get our property and money.\nfunky_duck: That doesnt answer why the average person is fine with seeing beer ads during every commercial break during sports but freaks out at the thought that a store that only sells to people 21+ will open within sight of a school.\ngrungebot5000: no, see, drug dealers are better because i dont have to acknowledge them on the way to workedit: forgot an /s is necessary here\nlosersalwayswin: drug dealers have known for years, that kids on playgrounds have to most disposable income\nitrv1: Shit in my hometown there is an elementary school across the street from a bar. No one blinks a fucking eye about that, or that I passed 3 bars on my walk to school.\nMaxidaz: 50 years from now these people will be satirized. Imagine, a world where children grow up knowing what marijuana is.\nMordfan: It really is amazing that the people who make fucking  are putting out scare ads saying how dangerous legal pot would be.\ngrungebot5000: well, the same company also just got permission from the government to manufacture a synthetic THC drug.  They dont want direct competition.\nIAmTheBaron: I just got arrested for a couple grams in KS, ridiculous. \nDrFistington: Thats really lame.  In my experience, especially in big cities, cops just have you throw out a few grams and break your pipe then send you on your way.  Its not worth the time and effort for them to have to take you to jail, have you processed and write up a report unless you have enough on you for a felony.\nIAmTheBaron: Exactly. Here, I spent a night and day in jail till I could get bailed out  ($1000 bail for possession and pipe ), and they tried to get me to wear a wire to buy LSD and shrooms. People just got shot here for that! So theyre trying to risk my life over $40 of pot.\nrekct: Thats disgusting. Not too long ago a kid got killed doing that after getting a marijuana charge.\ndatasciguy-aaay: Slavery is what the kid asked for though. He knew hed be a slave and worked to the death by that state.  Cmon./s\ndocket17: Did you enjoy laughing in their face?\nCallooh_Calais: That is unbelievable to me, as the only place Ive lived in America is San Francisco, and Ive never heard of anyone getting arrested for possession in all my years living here, and quite the opposite, I see people smoking quite openly.\nBendyMouse: Coloradan here.  Its not legal to smoke pot in public (still happens though, but rarely).  I was surprised at how prevalent it was when I visited SF.\nIamaBlackKorean: Ive never seen crack smoked so casually.\n-David Chappelle\nayyystunna: I also grew up in Sf. Once me and a buddy were hotboxing in Golden Gate Park under a street light in a dead end and a cop drove past us did a u-turn at the dead end and took off, so we pay no mind and continue smoking. 5 minutes later the cop comes driving back in followed by 2 more cop cars, we kinda shit it at this point and throw the blunt out window and let smoke bellow out the windows. They surround us, shine flashlights in our face and ask us if we have any tattoos etc... Turns out they were looking for someone who had stolen a car and ran away on foot. The cops then tell us we should smoke somewhere else because theres going to be a lot of police out tonight. :)\ntitanroi385: Go one state south to Oklahoma and that little bit of weed and pipe can get you two years your first time. Second you can be looking at ten. Thats for  amount, even the smallest seed or speck of resin.If you have a plant or anything else they can push for intent to distribute (like having more than one joint rolled) you can be facing a life sentence. Its also life if you make any type of oils or wax. They take that shit beyond serious here. A simple possession will ruin your life, career, and future. Cross the border and you can buy it in stores.\n(1 child): \nnappythrill22: That building you are referring to is not  but is actually called the . The King Dome was in Seattle and was torn down so they could build Safeco for the Mariners and CenturyLink for the Shechickens\ncyrusm: Either that or Kansas will build a giant wall to keep the hippies out. \nendadaroad: Maybe Colorado should build a wall to keep the assholes out.\nLexx4: Yep cheap BC bud \nrandomusername023: California too!\nstoddish: Or just cut education spending to cover costs. Whats the worst that could happen?\nMrBanden: People get dumber, but then you just blame the pot. Win-win?\nHyperdrunk: I dont live in Colorado, but my understanding is that legal pot (due to taxes) is marginally more expensive than illegal pot was before the switch. \nCallooh_Calais: We already pay taxes on medicinal in California, so unless legalisation comes with a hefty tax hike, I dont see the price going much higher.\nIlltakeblondie: Good, maybe itll get people off meth and pills and people can be just normal families again. \nWhat_Is_The_Meaning: No kidding, meth is really bad here.\nzzyzxzy: Seen them out in the middle of the road trying to snort up that white line...\nghostfox1_gfaqs: Worse over the state line though. Fuck Missouri \nPM_ME_WAT_YOU_GOT: Plus it means people arent buying from Mexican cartels.\nrandomusername023: or alcohol\nThaGerm1158: So then Colorado pot has taken over where it used to be Mexican pot. Seems like a win win to me ;)\ncodemoney: And it is REALLY GOOD STUFF. And youre welcome.\nstakoverflo: And whyyy does Colorado pot find its way into Kansas?Oh right, because the people want it.\nUsed-Car-Salesman: I-70 through Kansas is going to turn into a forfeiture gold mine just like I-40 through Oklahoma. Really, I think were going to see a new wave of aggressive highway robbery in red states that border blue states with legal weed. Theyll be camped out right over the border, waiting to steal money and property from anyone who decided to bring some legal weed back home.\nRowlansm: They are way ahead of you.  I already can drive through places that used to be speed traps confidently because I know the police are more focused on Colorado and other out of state plates on that highway. \nfunky_duck: Is it legal to have a Kansas plain clothes cop sitting outside the doors of the dispensaries closest to the CO border to report which people come out and get into cars with KY plates so the KY cops can stop them once they hit the border?\nDefiantHellrazor: No. Anything crossing state boarders is feds. If anything, the DEA are the ones watching the CO dispensaries from outside and inside the state for out of state tourists and feeding the information to the kansas state police or whatever direction the vehicle is traveling in (be it towards nebraska, new mexico, oaklahoma, wyoming, arizona or utah).\nrekct: Our tax dollars at hard work.\nTokeyWakenbaker: Perhaps.  It depends on what kind of agreement the two states can arrange.  As long as no one is arrested in CO by a KY cop, it could be legit \nenigmical: If this happens, then Colorado should spend a lot of money on sending trap cars through those corridors to show how corrupt those local police are.\nFlowStrong: It isnt legal if you bring it home, now is it?\nsleaze_bag_alert: so what you are saying, sir, is that the citizens of the state you represent massively want something that you refuse to give them?  Seems like you are missing an opportunity.\n120z8t: Oh no, low grade Mexican cartel weed is being replaced by grown in America high grade weed.  But really, how was this not also the case long before Colorado legalized?  Back when I use to smoke weed about 10 years ago a lot of the weed I smoked was coming from Colorado and I lived in Wisconsin at the time. \nZ0underkite: The cartels grow kindbud too, you know.\ntriarii7: oh dear lord people are doing things we disagree with that hurt no one else... wont some one think of the small humans!!!\nLogios: We cant allow people to use a harmless substance that makes them feel good.  We should lock them in cages and force them into slave labor for such an egregious act!  /sFunny how we pretend to be a free country.\njag986: You have the right to  happiness. You dont actually have the right to  happy.Next time you write a Declaration of Independence, dont let the lawyers get to it.\nZ0underkite: Funny how Hillary whipped out that new bullshit line about how Americas great because were good (while we largely support torture, among so much more).\nSudenlyLochNess: Shes just challenging Trumps whole MAGA line. And like most things in this election, the real answer should be in the middle ( things made better for the first time).\nSkeptictacs:  harmless substance that makes them feel good.You cant have both. Its a drug, with little testing.\njag986: Good thing alcohol isnt a drug thats readily available everywhere. I can get drunk and destroy my liver like God intended!\nSudenlyLochNess: The only downside about this argument is that it could be used to illegalize all drugs, prohibition style. just say no its that simple /s/s/s\nYzenDanek: Speak for yourself. Ive tested it plenty.\nSudenlyLochNess: Ive tested it many times and can confirm the most serious side effect Ive had yet was a case of couch lock.Scary shit.\nCaptainAxiomatic: Little testing? Cannabis been tested more than any other drug. It has been part of nature for millions of years, far longer than humans. Mammals, birds, and reptiles all have receptors for THC. Its been used by people with addictive personalities, self-destructive people who lack any sense of limits or proportion. Yet no one has ever died from using it.Compare the side effects of cannabis (silliness, sleepiness, the munchies) to those of laboratory pharmaceuticals, which are tested, yet even after approval have caused birth defects, heart valve damage, suicidal thoughts, liver damage....Little testing? Please.\nLogios: Not true at all.  Theres a ridiculous amount of evidence showing cannabis is not only harmless but helpful in many ways.\nSudenlyLochNess: I think harmless is a stretch, harmless in the same way that sugars and fat are harmless (too much can actually hurt a person) but much more harmless than cigarettes and alcohol. \nPotbrowniebender: Lets see the list of people who have died from overdose!\nLogios: List of people overdosing on cannabis:\nSudenlyLochNess: So did every famous Jewish athlete OD on pot?\nVirulentVoid: Oh, fuck right off.\nshahooster: With just another hundred law enforcement agencies, this would be a candidate for .\nmad_poet_navarth: crackpot also permeates Kansas. Seems like a little pot taxation might help the sitch.\nargumentativ: I want to know why Trump and Paul Ryan havent been forced to answer questions about why Kansas has a shitty economy even though it is a conservative dream. Where are all the jobs that are promised, and why would the outcome be any different if we tried it on a national scale.\n19Kilo: The current conservative narrative is that even though they cut taxes, the tax and spend government leeches didnt reduce spending at all, so of course theyre over budget.Oh, and of course, the Liberal Supreme Court in Kansas wont let them cut spending and keeps forcing hikes in school costs.\nGenerallyBetter: Kansas, be cool for once in your life.\nevannever: lived there... dont hold your breath. \nClewin: I concur - my uncle lives there in the only pocket of liberalism (Lawrence). The majority is more like the nuts at Topekas Westboro Baptist Church. Dont get me wrong - I dont hate conservatism, but religious conservatism with radical values is the norm there. Thus the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which was created to protest Intelligent Design and Creationism there in public schools.\nVicemore: There is nothing conservative about putting your tax base in jail and ensuring they are welfare cases for a long time.  Ive said for a long time that social and financial conservatism are at odds with each other.  You have to pick one or claim the hypocrisy card.\nSinhumane: no, drive the 6 hours to colorado and inhale deeply before coming back. \nSudenlyLochNess: AHAHAHAgood one Source: once attempted to live there, CO for lyfe\nall_things_code: Fuck Kansas.Lived there for too long. There is nothing for anyone there. There are no jobs. There is no recreation. The government leadership is the bottom of the barrel. The education system is one of the worst in the country. The homeschooling / anti vaccer crowd is large. The budget is in bad shape. The cops have nothing better to do than fuck with people, and they know you cant really run, because theres nowhere to go. Its a prison without walls for many who would leave if they could.\n3OH3: most of the people I met in Kansas hadnt ever left the state before. Theyre all from these small towns and dont know anything else which is probably why they dont leave. Only place that was bearable was Lawerence but theres still no way Id ever live there\nall_things_code: The only thing to do there is grow old and die. Which is exactly what they do there.\nIAmTheBaron: Living there now, its pretty much hell. Glad its not just me \ndrhugs: Im pretty sure the Kansas City of song here I come is Kansas City, Missouri... so theres that.\napplebottomfeeder: Kansas is permeated by the money of the alcohol, pharma, and prison industry he means. \nzacdenver: Permeated with the stench of Brownback, you mean.\nSpacemanD13: It permeates NYC as well. Nice to know the stuff here isnt coming from cartel. \nwhiglet: Exactly that was my first thought: \nHardcaseKid: Gosh, guess you might as well legalize it and get on the gravy train, huh?\nIronyElSupremo: Didnt a suit from neighbors Nebraska and/or Oklahoma get tossed out?  They are all just pissed many Kansans (and others) are spending their money on those August ski trips to Colorado.\nnotgrowingup: Yeah, I think this was Nebraska. They lost.\nRocketsponge: Have you tried burning it?  Specifically, dividing it up into small amounts, rolling it in flammable paper to help controlled combustion, and then applying a small match or lighter?\nVictorianGasbubble: Try not to drool on. It so much, Kansas. \neatinglotsofstuff: Build a wall and make Colorado pay for it!\nLysergicHysteric: I think Colorado would be cool with that proposition.\nLtCthulhu: Shit I bet a bunch of states would be willing to throw in a bit to wall that place off.\ncodemoney: AND add a dome. Or just bury the whole thing underground.\nk-laz: Add a dome?Simpsons did it!\nDefiantHellrazor: Yeah, because that worked so well for Berlin...\nFreedomSquatch: This is the free market at work, Kansas. Youre going to have to legalize it and come up with your own stains of dank if you hope to compete.\nphysicsfan1: Theyre having a hard enough time in Kansas - they should let people get high there just to deal with it.\nFishstickIsles: Would he prefer cartel brand instead?\nDrFistington: Yeah, and before they were permeated with Colorado pot, it was canadian pot, or california pot, or mexican pot, etc, etc.Its almost as if people that want to use marijuana are going to do it regardless of where it comes from, and whether or not its legal in their state.I guess the Kansas AG could just accept the reality of the situation and legalize it in their state, which would reduce arrests and incarceration rates in the state while simultaneously creating a new industry which will help drive employment and increase tax revenue for Kansas by billions.Then again, fuck that, I mean Kansas is already perfect, so why try to make it any better, right?\nThaGerm1158: Agreed except for that last line, I think Texas already owns the Copywrite on that /s\nnowomandontfly: The Constitution of the US and Colorodo say: too bad, its the law.This is just an attempt to get more funding to throw at marijuana.\nxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxy: And if you have Colorado license plates and you are driving across Kansas on I70, you can pretty much guarantee that the state police will pull you over looking for marijuana if you look like a user.So be aware.\nApt_5: I feel like I would read this same sentence in an article promoting mj legalization.\nMarket0: Hopefully Colorado laws permeate the rest of the country.\nNorthernerWuwu: Why would people that are going to illegally sell pot products in Kansas pay retail in CO? I mean, there  still a lot of illegal bulk sources that give quite the discount over Colorados legal stores.Im sure a lot of personal shopping happens but I dont see this being the majority.\nfunky_duck: Not everyone has connections to buy in bulk, but anyone can go across the border to CO, make a legal purchase, and then charge and an arbitrage fee to others.It probably isnt a big problem but it does make it much easier for people to get into small-time dealing especially if they are users themselves and are already going to CO - why not pick up twice as much and sell it for 25% more than you paid?\nRemingtonSnatch: If I was Colorado, my response would be no more than this:Your problem.\ndocket17: It is. \nzacdenver: ...or another two-word reply: Tough shit.\nGoaheadownvoteme: Im sure the Koch permeates Kansas a lot more\nfunky_duck: Havent the Kochs come out in favor of the free market with cannabis?  They really are more of the Libertarian mindset than conservative.\nLibAtheist: Yes.  The Kochs also hire a lot of felons too.  They also support criminal justice reform.  Not ideal on the environmental front, but theyre not the monsters liberals make them out to be. \nJoeZMar: Attention: people living outside of the legal states also like good weed.\nRowlansm: And forget to take off the packaging showing where they got it while they are transporting it. \nBburrito: That is the best part.  Save for finding it in cars at the border... how do you know it came from Colorado and is not coming from someone inside the state? \nSkeptictacs: I would guess packaging. People go to colorado, get there weed that is packaged for legal sale, and drive home. They get busted in their home and there is weed still in the sale packaging becasue why would you remove it?\nFluffyBunnyHugs: Dorthy and Todo are displeased that they cant grow their own and have to buy it from Colorado.  \nafisher123: \nkriswone: act like you couldnt get weed before, or is your short term memory loss affecting you?\nneuromonkey: Everybody panic.Whew. Now lets go get a drink.\nRtreesaccount420: Good, maybe people in Kansas will chill the fuck out for a bit.\nAcrimony01: Well it is the \nDuchessJulietDG: Oz finally happened. So green!\nISuckAtJiuJitsu: Best thing to happen to Kansas since.... ever?\nspacednlost: Idiocy permeates Kansas.\nmad-n-fla:  pot \u201cpermeates\u201d Kansas, says attorney general ....\nGeezusManForReal: Man this is so true! I stopped smoking the last 8 years cuz I didnt wanna lose my CDL but I just recently got out of trucking and started smoking again. Every bag Ive bought has been extremely high grade. Everybodys got it now in Kansas it seems. Definitely wasnt this way 8 years ago.\nfckyourselfsarah: Kansas AG makes press release about an opinion poll he created.Blames nearby state for not holding down its people enough.  \nfckyourselfsarah: Kansas Attorney General makes press release about how Kansas society is being destroyed by Colorado drugs.Ignores that Colorado has had zero negative effects, increased budget money, and is saving money on prosecution and imprisoning marijuana users.  Also experiencing drop in prescription drug abuse.\nNemacolin: Can Kansas continue to be safe against the evils of evolution without a wall?\nAutumnFan714: Looks like Kansas has some legalizing to do.\nMistaMxyzptlk: You can only hope that some of the nuts in Kansas will get a chance to try an actual medicine provided by nature and not pharmaceutical companies. Go Colorado.\nKinnasty: Im fully in favor of legalizing marijuana across the nation....but I think people take the idea of marijuana as some miracle cure all a little too far\nMistaMxyzptlk: It isn\u2019t a miracle cure unless you suffer from seizures or PTSD or Chron\u2019s disease. The point is, America has been jailing its citizens for over 100 years when in fact it should never have been prohibited. Thousands of Americans lost decades behind bars for doing something that is very beneficial for many people. Now the Libertarian Candidate for President, Johnson is actually in the Cannabis Industry. It was long time for this change.\nClewin: I personally dont care one way or the other about legalization - criminalization of use with ridiculous sentences is what gets me. Combine that with states like Texas that have laws that require prisoners to work for no pay for companies to profit off of = drug slavery. It is even worse than the US government owned company Unicor, which pays as little as 23 cents an hour for such work.\nsonyka: Wonder what his stance is on gun laws.\nscabsgohome: So is there any actual state government agency (since the FDA obviously cant) that is regulating the health and safety standards for marijuana products? I remember reading somewhere that a lot of the marijuana edibles for sale had all kinds of e. coli, rat scat, and gram-negative bacteria in them.Edit: Dont know why Im being downvoted. Just asking a question, as that would presumably be a concern of the AG if the products arent safe for human consumption.\n120z8t: If they are making food then they will have to comply with all the state health regulations that food manufactures/restaurants have to follow.  \nSkeptictacs: Oregon does testing.\nThaGerm1158: Thats why youre getting downvoted. Thats nothing more than hearsay until its linked to a source. No hate, just answering your other question. \nscabsgohome: Thanks. Didnt think about that. I found it here; looks like its from \n',

 'desc': u'etherpromo: Uplifting as fuck.  Hits home because Im from SF, and theres always many elderly Chinese folks who does what Joyce does on a daily.  Silently and always politely collecting cans, whether to pay for rent or put their kids/grandkids through school.  Never will you see them beg for handouts, which is why I respect them to the max.\nChernoobyl: I used to collect cans like crazy as a kid so I could buy toys with my friend\nStuckinaloop: In the Outer Sunset we have , she is super cool and takes no shit.When I worked/lived in the TL there was the neighborhood can lady we all loved, but she passed a few years ago.For about a block around where I live now there are two main ones, one is my neighbor that mainly takes care of her grandchildren and lives in a neighbors basement. The other is newer but for an older Asian person really likes my dog and my dog likes her too, so I split my returnable recycling up about 50/50 between the two.As far as I am concerned, anyone that puts that amount of time in, they can have my returnables.\netherpromo: Thanks for sharing!  Im actually from outer sunset, on Kirkham St!  I moved to Orange County area for college and have been here since; the video was very nostalgic :)  \nStuckinaloop: Im 1400 block in the outer on an ave.Our main can ladies are my neighbor, but since her daughter graduated she mainly takes care of the Grandkids (I know one is hers, but theres usually 3 or 4 around,( she used to have that super mean super short Chihuahua looking dog that looked like a sausage with teeth on one end but it died and now has a slightly less mean one), and still makes the rounds, and another lady about the same age and really tiny but fresher off the boat who wears one of those pointy bill caps and big ass sun glasses who really humps it hard 7 days a week.If we put them in the blue can, everything else tends to get spread all over the sidewalk so for the last few years we have had a little multilingual sign on the lid that says no cans no bottles just cardboard, so that helps keep the sidewalk cleaner. The way I  look at is this, in a month I might generate $12 worth of returnables, since they have closed most of the places to redeem them a round trip would take 2hrs to get that $12. If someone is going to put out the work and can combine whatever they get from me with whatever they get from others and it works out for them Im good with that.\netherpromo: Yeah I definitely see that.  Only thing I have to disagree on with however is the mess.  From experience Ive seen these ladies dissect these bins and only take the cans/recyclables, but they always make sure to put the other garbage back in.  Cant say the same for the homeless guys though, they usually just leave a mess everywhere they go (not to be mean, just objectively speaking).\nStuckinaloop: The old ladies dont make a mess, the tweakers make the mess. Last night was garbage night, so I was cleaning up this morning.\nThemohohs: I watched a drunk asshole berate an elderly chinese woman for collecting cans one night out in SF. I was with colleagues but I regret not smacking the shit out of him to this day. Some people got to make a living, its 100x more honorable than holding a sign in a street corner.\nRaziehh: Ever since I saw that post about that man handing out resumes(whether it was legit or not.) \nI seem to have zero patience for pan handlers. \nstanreach: thats quite a blanket condemnation of pan handlers, many of whom in my old town had severe mental help problems to the point where they would refuse help. These people arent really gonna be handing out CV\u015b\nAlbert_Spangler: Especially when it turns out they have an apartment and a part time job as a delivery driver. And their place burned down two years ago.\nPMMEPICSOFSALAD: But you just berated street corner sign holders? Is that not incredible hypocritical?\nblack_phone: Live in the Bay area, used to live in a state that didnt tax or reimburse for bottles or cans. They are really common, Im 1000% fine with the program as it supports cleaning and recycling. The only time Ive ever been bothered was when one of them was taking from a recycling bin, which IMO defeats the purpose.\nZ0underkite: Thats just cold hard American work ethic.\nPollish-N-insert: Exactly, is my life in any way shape or form worstened by someone taking cans out of my bin? Not at all,  one time I even told a cranked out looking dude he can keep coming back if he keeps it clean, and he did until I moved out, no problems at all.  And theres always those dudes on bike with what seems like a million cans.  Doing what they have to in order to survive.\nConsentingPenguin: I lived in San Francisco for a year and it seemed like going through recycle bins on the street was their primary thing. Saw one of them come by my place almost daily. They were kind of like ghosts. Very quiet and never made a mess. Technically  is something you can report but I dont think it happens since they never bother anyone.Edit: And for some reason its always an older asian person. Ive always wondered if its some sort of organized collective with negotiated turf.\nkelskelsea: It is negotiated turf, at least within residential areas\nsimilar_observation: Heads up, sometimes its not for money. Sometimes its because theyre just looking for an activity. We have a local trash lady that collects furniture, as well as bottles and cans. Shes not poor, but actually the wife of a well off doctor. She does it because she loves directly working for charity and it gives her something to do. From what I understand, she refurnishes the furniture and donates them to needy families.\nFirstGearGames: Skaters only get a bad reputation because most of them are teenagers, and we all know how mature teenagers generally are. \nangryd0g: The difference between teenagers and adults is experience. Ive definitely met some mature teenagers, I was shocked by the age of some people Ive met.\nGeshtiannaSG: Its not just experience but significant biological differences. Their brains are very different.\nborrabnu: You can be immature and still nice.\nSaloondoggle: Im not so sure, the kind of people to stay skaters well after their teens probably give them a bad rap, too\nliquiiid: What the hell? Why? Skateboarding is a sport. Would you say the same thing about a person in their 30s playing a pick up game of basketball at a park with their friends? \nUgglyCasanova: As a 25 y/o with a college degree and a steady job who still skateboards, I have to disagree.\nJDolan283: Awesome story, though...What asshole decided not to save a shirt for Henry? Hes her husband, after all! He deserves nice things too!Edit: Henry is not a wife. Oops.\nMozzy: I have a feeling hes her husband actually.\nJDolan283: Thanks for the catch. >.> Fixed that up.\nhhunterhh: Oh thumbnails, how they mislead us\njamesdeee: Fucking Canada.  Why do you have to make everyone else look bad?\ntimception: I wanna go to Canada, people are so nice.\nreverseskip: Sorry, eh? \ntwinnedcalcite: Sorry, we cant help it.\nalderinn: If it makes you feel better, 3 blocks north of this park has plenty of bad things going on.\njamesdeee: But even your bad parts of town are friendly. \nhalborn: Bad people make themselves look bad.  Good people just show that the bar doesnt have to be so low.  \nIamninjass: This is really cool and it shows that skateboarders will accept anybody\nDiscountTedDanson: As with any group of people, there are nice folks and there are assholes.\nKarmatsocheff: Ive been a skateboarder for over 25 years. Genuinely feel bad for non skateboarders. Its the most beautiful brotherhood of man. The places Ive been and the people Ive met, its amazing. It trumps everything. Israeli and Palestinian skaters would have a great session together. Its a level of connection that surpasses race, religion, nationality, and etc. its truly incredible.  \nWithTheWintersMight: Weird. Part of why I drifted away from skating was the way better skaters would clique up and talk shit/be rude to those of us who werent as skilled. \nIamninjass: Yea I just use my board to ride around but when I went to college me and my roommates bonded over skating around with each other \nborrabnu: man the israeli and palestinian skateboards musta hated each other\nGronkalicious: The skater kids I dealt with were no more accepting than the preppy jock kids. \nIamninjass: Im sorry that happened to you\nsweatyyetsalty: will accept anybody. Dude do you realize how your statement reads?\nButtToucherIRL: We have a guy like that in our neighborhood, I should ask him his name. Hes always very polite and always helps me take my bins out. We made sure to buy a separate bin for bottles/cans so he didnt have to rummage through the huge recycling bin. \n_pope_francis: Skateboarders get a bad rap.  Nice to see a feel good story about skaters.\nThe_Anomaly101: Gotta post this on \nlucidshred: There are several people at my local skatepark that have been coming everyday for as long as I can remember\nMr_Randy_Watson: Damn Vancouver, we already love you enough.. now if you see only an affordable option for a future move \nhubblebubble691: In the people involved in this story, and the happiness they give to each other, lies the salvation of our world.\nscrewuapple: Excellent.Was that sweet Dee on the left??\nmellownova: No just a bird\nDJ_HOBE: W2C that dope ass shirt?\npiggiex3: What a great story!!! So uplifting!I hope Henry gets a shirt too.\nkinkgirlwriter: Nice to read something in  that actually puts a smile on my face. Happy birthday, Joyce!\nwithmirrors: Someone needs to give her husband one of the tee shirts with her face on it, I cant believe nobody thought of saving him one.\nTheBloodEagleX: ...and they made her clean up after the party. Kidding\nborrabnu: That was very sweet of them to do for her.\n1trueFan: Super cool! I want to be as cool as them when Im 75. \nPNCL: This is uplifting but thats 13 chances they had to do this :/ \nDeathoftheages: How many of the same kids have been skating there for that long?  I bet most spend only a summer hanging out there.\nCitymike: Theres a bunch of us thatve been there for 13 years :) \nDeathoftheages: Oh wow good on you guys.\nNivlac024: Although it doesnt say it Im sure many of them have celebrated her birthday in the past \ndookieface: I have always said littering provides jobs\nCitymike: Joyce is an amazing woman. Id always save my cans for her at home as well. Id never have enough to bother taking them in myself, and it was always nice seeing her in my ally, and at the park.\nenigma9133: Holy shit. Is this really possible? How much recycling would you have to do to pull off something like this?\nYouProbablySmell: Man I hope I never become a 40 year old skater known as Bumbles.\nBloodandBourbon: I feel stupid, at first I was like cool they got george takei to show up. Then I realized it was the women in the first picture.\nPanicR00M: I thought so as well.. \U0001f605\ndagst3r: This is a nice, uplifting story. However, it was published July 20th. So, its not news.\nIAmTheNight2014: From the incredibly small thumbnail, it looks like Kim Jong Un wearing a dress.\n',

Problem solved.When using Ubuntu, ElementaryOS, of whatever flavour you like, you also dont get those annoying  messages. Also no waiting for updates to finish when starting your computer.\nk-h: The updates are still required under linux, more, because linux includes all the apps as well as the OS.

But yea, just dont make a fuss or well be in a bit of a pickle.\nHoMaster: Until theyve arrested all your neighbors and youre the only one left. \nadmrlty: Heres another! Theyre everywhere!EDIT:  And another! .\nilluminatiman: we are all terrorists \nsyboxez: on this blessed day\nNewYork_NewJersey440: Speak for yourself\ni_tried_butt_fuck_it: I are all terrorists on this blessed day?\ngoogolplexbyte: All are terrorists on belong to I.\nserg06: Scotland Yard has performed an internal investigation and found no terrorism associated with the government pages. They are now asking for all usernames and passwords of  to finish their investigation, but Reddit is not giving those up, so clearly they have something to hide.\nKoldsaur: Now actual terrorists will be making fake police pages with https and it will get mixed in with the bunch of allowed pages.\nrockboy421: Oh the humanity\nBirdinhandandbush: Id vote you up but I dont want to end up on a no fly list\nRollerRagerMD: GCHQ algorithms have determined your intent to upvote and placed you on the list anyway.\nm42ngc1976: Psycho Pass anyone?\nkeastes: WC? \nElek3103: The upvoters threat judgement has been reappraised.\nsenorbolsa: Enforcement mode is Lethal Eliminator\nRealtrain: Geocaching Head Quarters?\nTony49UK: Government Communications Head Quarters, the UK equivalent of the NSA and which has less legal oversight.  The Home Secretary signs an order every three months which allows them to intercept all digital communications in or entering and leaving the UK, which is about 25% of the worlds data.\n99639: The other great thing is this: the US and most other countries like the UK have laws regarding surveillance on their citizens.  They cant usually just spy on everyone without getting a court order or some form of approval (even if its a rubber stamp).  But there are rarely any prohibitions of surveillance on FOREIGN citizens abroad.  So the US spies on the UK people and the UK spies on the US people and they hand the info to each other.  No laws broken and everyone gets spied upon.  Excellent!\nTony49UK: In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher wanted to tap the telephone line of a minister in her cabinet Michael Heseltine.  But couldnt get British intelligence to do it without make a statement to Parliament due to the Wilson Doctrine.  So she got the RCMP to do it, who at the time were the main Canadian intelligence agency.\n_Timboss: How can a Canadian agency tap a British phone line, especially if he makes calls to other people in the UK so the telephone connection never leaves our shores? \nsingularineet: Well if its the RCMP, they do it by riding their horse over to the telephone exchange, taking their equipment out of a saddlebag, and hooking it up to the targeted line.\nAnla-shok: Moose.FTFY\nTony49UK: By popping round to his local telephone cabinet and adding a recording device to his line or by using the SF method, where on older phones you could put a washer in the telephone handset, that would then turn the telephone line to the junction box into a radio transmitter allowing a radio and recording device nearby to record it.  \nIntellisaurDinoAlien: You must be one of those terrorists we hear so much about.\nmormotomyia: \nXaVierDK:  No legal oversight. \nFjorgVanDerPlorg: I think we might be out the other side and into Undersight territory here.Edit:typo\nfezzuk: Well the nsa spys on UK citizens and gchq spys on American citizens and then the intellegence agencys that receive the information swap it.That way the UK government is not spying on its citizens and the American government isnt spying on theirs.I love that this is an actual fact not some silly conspiracy theory & apparently no one gives a flying fuck.When I say this to people in general they dont even seam to know.\nlayendecker: If you didnt have anything to hide, then you would be happy about this!Not sure why Robert Hannigan got pissed off with me rummaging through his bins and called the police. \nlolreallythou: Well...fuck. They have a lot of my dick pics I suppose\nCeedub260: Im gonna pretend it means Gotham City. \nnotenoughspaceforthe: Dont worry - I heard criminals in Gotham get put back out on the street in no time! Seems theyve got a super lenient penal system there!\nCeedub260: Only if youre the worst of the worst. Low level criminals go away and are never seen again. \nJippsTV: So....gotham city is colombia...?\necheese: Basically youre safe if your name starts with The\ntheTANbananas: Its the UK NSA\nsoawesomejohn: Wait. The UK has 4 letter agencies? Well.. I guess it makes sense. UK has 2 letters, USA has 3. So USANSA will have the same amount of letters as UKGCHQ. Our agencies have more vowels though.\nee3k: G and H are vowels in Wales.\nValueBrandCola: In Wales everything is a phlegmy cough noise.\nSandyBadlands: If we discount repeat letters, yours only has four. And ours is worth more in scrabble (in a homeruled game that allows acronyms, obviously) :)And yours is declaring that someone is the eldest daughter of Ned Stark.\nSpeech500: Technically, the NSA is the American GCHQ. \nLord-Fumblebuck: Its alright, everyone is on the list until such time as a reason to remove you is provided.Reasons for removal include: Death by drone. \ndoppelgaber: Guys this isnt funny any more. The world is becoming a dystopian nightmare and we are making jokes!\nMsPenguinette: Using port 443 is enough to prove intent to commit a terrorist act. You will now be treated as an enemy combatant.\nTheInfinityGauntlet: Enjoy prison criminal scum!\ntranquil21: \nVikingDom: I REALLY dont think this is true. My guess is that he was arrested for ties to ISIS and in the arrest report all this was noted. Then some lawyer colluded with a click whoring journalist to pick out some words/phrases that makes it seem incredibly dubious.   Again,  this is me guessing. I have absolutely NO knowledge of this particular case, but every God damn time theres an article covering something this outrageous,  its always  a special interest group/ lawyer fucking with a gullible excuse of a journalist. \nwithabeard: Then he should be charged with being an actual terrorist.He has been charged with sideways issues that should not be illegal for me or you to do. But if we cement these things in law, will be. Then we are faced with only being able to selectively apply the law.[edit] Seems what I want is exactly what theyre doing. \nVikingDom: Oh he is.. After a 5 minute search:In reality he is charged with directing terrorism. Side charges includes providing training in encryption programs knowing the purpose was for terrorism, and using his blog site to provide such training. And further \u201cthe intention of assisting another or others to commit acts of terrorism\u201d.In addition he is charged with having a plan on a USB cufflink, for a (undisclosed) purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism.Ullah is also charged with having \u201cin his possession articles namely a book about guided missiles and a PDF version of a book about advanced missile guidance and control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism\u201d.The first charge is directing terrorism. The side charges is enabling and instigating terrorism. The modes (USB cufflink and encrypted blog) are mentioned, but not what he really is charged with. \nPunishableOffence: Stop. Youre doing a disservice to the truth. The blog is not encrypted in any way; only traffic between the blog and its readers is.The blog content is completely plaintext, not encrypted, not ciphered, it is just text.But GCHQ wants to know who is reading that text, and to do that, they must have access to the traffic.They are not reading the blogs content. They are not taking the blog readers computers and looking for possible terrorist activity.They are slurping up everything, all of our Internet communications (be it a terrorist chatroom or just reading the news) and collecting everything into a database that can be easily searched by keyword.Everything you do on the Internet is recorded in this database .This is why they are trying to first make suspect, then criminalize encrypted traffic. They want to know what were thinking so they can control what were thinking.\nF0sh: The article says:In other words, the contention that the charge is due to it being provided over HTTPS is pure speculation.\nCynicalYetOptimistic: The writer says as much in the article saying g it doesnt specify and assuming they mean HTTPS.\nd4rch0n: And if they compromised a root CA, using https wouldnt help. Id be surprised if they hadnt.verisign runs the game for the most part and I personally dont trust that they dont work with the US government. Their hq isnt far at all from intelligence hq. If they work with the US government, they likely work with the UK directly or indirectly.Speculation but I think its likely knowing how things are today.\nbrickmack: Why the fuck is having a book about missile guidance a crime?Guess Im about to go to jail for a very long time, silly me for having an interest in spaceflight\ncoopiecoop: exactly.the idea that something legal can turn illegal because of the context is laughable.a prominent example: (imo) it would be stupid if the pages of a clothing catalog that have kids presenting swimsuits would somehow be perceived into child pornography because thats what the authorities suspect you of possession with (or even if you also possess other, actual child porn).\nbrickmack: Hell, thats what happened with Michael Jackson. The child porn they found in his mansion was just art books with naked kids in them. Its kinda weird, but perfectly legal and nonsexual, I found a copy of one of them in a bookstore a while back\nDynamicDK: Kinda like the issue with Napalm Girl on Facebook recently.  It was being censored until people got pissed off and Facebook reversed the decision.There is nothing sexual about that picture.  It is an award winning image that shows the horror of war.\ncoopiecoop: and that doesnt even mean that I get where people are coming from with this.to use the latter example of mine: if someone possesses actual child porn, of course its not far-fetched to assume that person used those legal pictures of children for sexual stimulation as well. (imo) the latter still shouldnt be illegal, because it still is just a mere assumption about something that would usually be perfectly legal.\nRoboticide: This is more or less true.  The actual source,  says that he was already suspected of being an ISIS wannabe.  Its very likely he was doing more than just using https, thats pure supposition.Not to say that what they did is okay.  It sets a bad precedent and they should have just waited to charge him with a real crime, but this article is click bait.  Its not like theyre pulling people off the street for using https.\nMeloetta: This is a very helpful link. Ars mentions that the actual charge is preparation of terrorism, with the means of the preparation being teaching terrorists encryption techniques. Its bad logic to reverse it the way the first link has - saying that these things are the means he used to prepare terrorists doesnt mean that everyone using it will be charged with preparation of terrorists. Its like if the police said youre charged with theft by means of picking up an item in the store and leaving with it and people said the police say leaving the store with items is theft, we can never buy anything anymore!\nVikingDom: No, the source of the blog post is ars technica. The actual source is the arrest report and the police themselves. As you can see they dont pull any direct quotes from the actual source.\nbitchkat: Does that make Lets Encrypt an arms dealer?\nArve: Phil Zimmerman was subject to a criminal investigation for allegedly violating the Arms Export Control Act over PGP, when it first came around. He also, after the cat was already was out of the bag, creatively exported it legally, by publishing it as a hardback book which was not subject to arms export regulations. \nMoebiusStreet: It got more creative than that. I have a T-shirt from the time featuring the RSA algorithm in machine-readable barcode. The shirt read across the top: This T-shirt is a munition.\nescalat0r: Thought of this as well, \nMagneon: I mean, is is written in perl which could by itself be considered a war crime. \nBlrfl: Perls kind of fitting because Keith Bostic used to say that Perl is the only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption.\nPyLog: As someone who has to go through a huge codebase written in Perl for work, I full heatedly agree.\nYipRocHeresy: Watch out guys, hes in heat. They can be aggressive when in heat. \nInVultusSolis: Perl isnt a bad language at all if youre using it for its intended purpose: applications where there is nothing but text in the pipeline. But the bitch of it is, its one of those languages where it gives you more than enough rope to hang yourself with and you can fuck up in spectacularly bad ways if youre not familiar with the arcana of the language. In the hands of inexperienced developers, this can lead to some terrible, terrible code. My company uses Perl, but were pretty strict with new people about  they code. We stop the fuck-ups early.\nChronoloraptor: Im still surprised youve managed to hire people who actually want to and can code in perl for a living, you must be paying them a fortune. \nInVultusSolis: Its great job security! And yeah, its hard to find good talent so it commands a premium.\nreprapraper: No, perl was actually snuck out of lab working on top secret projects.\nshadowjudge: I mean, is is written in perl which  by itself  is a war crime.Corrected for factual accuracy.\nMicp: But i just wanna run perl man!\ndadbrain: Joel (Furr) wouldnt ship them outside the USA because he (rightly) was worried the FBI would get him for exporting munitions.\nWhargod: Years ago you could be banned from traveling if you had a tattoo of the RSA encryption algorithm on your skin as it was labeled munitions.Heres a little something I dug up on it. I remember in high school hearing about this years before it was struck down in 96.\nnetuoso: From the article\nacgk: I wonder if this would have prevented the government from extraditing you back then...\nzarex95: One of the most awesome hacks that I know of. \njaymz168: Until the mid- to late-90s strong encryption was limited by arms control laws in the US and you couldnt export strong encryption, so historically speaking youre pretty much spot on.  The removal of these limitations is what enabled online commerce to flourish.\nerror1954: Is that law still in effect at all? Im just wondering because in my cryptography textbooks they say that we should be careful implementing the algorithms lest we be tried for exporting arms.\nkickopotomus: Yes. Software still falls under the US export control purview. Its generally good to get anything that could have military applications (i.e. encryption) cleared before putting it up some place to download. You dont even have to explicitly send it to a foreign national. Simply putting your project somewhere that it can be downloaded overseas is seen as an export in the eyes of the government. You also have to be careful where you store it. For instance, say you live in the US but use some hosting service with servers outside of the US. Even if you are just using the server for your private git repo, you need to make sure your data stays in the US and isnt even replicated on a foreign server. Its dumb, but again, that is seen as an export by the government.\nWarfinder: Looks like that isnt true. I cant find a Supreme Court case but the ninth and sixth circuit at least have ruled against it.I cant really see how it isnt against the first amendment so the law is likely unenforceable especially today.\nkickopotomus: There are still export regulations on encryption software. You are pointing at cases which altered the restrictions but did not strike them outright. Export laws still exist and they still pertain to software.\nWarfinder: Can you link to a case where they actually convicted someone under that law? Because otherwise it seems unconstitutional and they are afraid of enforcing it. In one of the cases I listed the judge refused to review the new regulations because a serious threat by the government hadnt been made.\nhow_do_i_land: You probably shouldnt be writing code to implement any encryption algorithm. Use an off the shelf implementation and avoid a number of side channel and other attacks.\niamtoe: Might be kinda hard if you are studying cryptography at a higher level.\nfr0stbyte124: You shouldnt be studying cryptography at all.  Use off-the-shelf cryptography students.\nNatanael_L: Everybody should learn about cryptography. The problem isnt studying it, the problem is overestimating your abilities. \nchristophski: You shouldnt be estimating anything at all. Use off-the-shelf estimations of your ability.\nNatanael_L: I tried, but ran into the Halting problem \nfr0stbyte124: Was it an off-the-shelf Halting problem?\nerror1954: I wasnt thinking of publishing code I wrote for serious uses, but more so what would happen if I implemented textbook RSA for fun and my code was on github.\ngustl: Can the encryption used in the web still be considered to be strong?\npatrys: The list of available web ciphers and protocols is updated as weaknesses are discovered (or as enough computing power becomes available) that would allow security to be compromised.Newer releases of browsers and server software refuse to exchange information with peers that use combinations of protocols, ciphers and secrets that are known to be weak (sometimes the algorithm is fine but a certificate is known to be compromised which could allow a man-in-the-middle to act as an eavesdropping relay).\nceph3us: IIRC strong encryption is a legal definition, which is (rather archaically) defined as anything considered to provide greater encryption strength than a symmetric 48-bit encryption cipher (or equivalent bit strength for asymmetric ciphers, which for any realistic used algorithm like RSA or ECDSA is far smaller than any key length commonly used today), mainly because the litmus test was whether a government agency could reasonably crack it at that time.Incidentally, one of the reasons that DVD copy protection was/is laughably easy to break is because the more draconian export laws at the time meant that it would be legally very difficult to use anything stronger.\nkzig: With something like a DVD you have the added constraint of having to give the consumer the key as well as the lock so that they can still view your content - the strength of the lock ultimately wouldnt have made much difference.\nRollerRagerMD: They just need to appoint Oliver North as CEO and then theyll be fine.\nkn33: \U0001f3b6I am an arms dealer, fitting you with weapons in the form of code\U0001f3b6\n1s44c: Worse. They are spreading terrorist ideology.\nlindet16: Heres another article that isnt as sensationalist. \nevilscary: That makes things a bit more understandable\nimVERYhighrightnow: Precedent is still precedent though.\nShaper_pmp: The precedent here is quite specific though:etc, etc, etc.You cant simply hand-wave away the intent the way this clickbaity bullshit article is trying, because .Its like charging someone for murder vs. manslaughter vs. a verdict of accidental death - all three are concerned with the death of a human being, but if you remove intent or other relevant context from the consideration theyre functionally identical, which is nonsense.These articles are literally ignoring half the sentence that defines the overfeed m offence(s) in order to present the offence as over-broad and dangerous, when (at least as presented in the charge sheet) theyre nothing of the type.Carrying a boot able thumb drive, or publishing an encrypted blog (or even owning a firearm or explosives) are not  illegal - its the intent for which you own them that makes it a chargeable offence... and misrepresenting the charge as the fact of ownership (rather than the  the fact of ownership) the way this article does is fundamentally dishonest.Lets debate about the merits of the law if people like, but to do that usefully we have to at least be honest about what the law , and not just believe misleading bullshit ginned up for extra controversy and tasty, tasty ad impressions.\nLord_Skellig: Certainly intent is a large part of the prosecution system. However, in the example you mentioned, the physical event - someone has died, will  require a police investigation, and if someone has been found to have caused it, they will be charged with an offence. Specifically  offence it is will depend on the details.Here, we have an example of an action which is not aprori a crime - giving instruction on encryption, that has apparently become a crime because of what the police believe this persons intention was.\nOhCrapBrickedIt: What new precedent does this establish? He is being charged with Assisting Terrorism, the mens rea for which being .Reddit is literally complaining about an IS member on the UK mainland being arrested on completely justified terrorism charges.\nraaneholmg: This explain why they went after him, but they are still trying to convict him, among other things, for using conventional security schemes.\nBeeb294: If you legally own a gun (in america, which I know the article isnt, but bear with me for the purpose of illustration), nobody is coming after you for legally owning, training, and using that gun. If you use guns and gun knowledge to train and enhance terrorism, then youre breaking the law. Even if youre using conventional guns and gun safeties. Anything legal can be used illegally or for illegal purposes. Including computer security techniques \nruttin_mudders: Youd have to knowingly train and enhance terrorism. Otherwise any person who taught any skill would be open to arrest if a student decided to be come a terrorist or was already one in hiding. \nTheHatFullOfHollow: Actually, nothing in that article improves this situation in the slightest for those with a modicum of understanding of what is being discussed here, but thanks for editorializing.They are clearly discussing Linux on an USB drive (I was a Linux LiveCD distro co-developer) and designating it as used for terrorism which is terrible precedent-setting horse shit weve inherited from the redefinitions of what preparation for terrorism means.\nBeeb294: This article says that he was charged with doing these things specifically knowing that they would be used for terrorism purposes. Its not saying that all use of encryption is for terrorism, but that using that knowledge and skills to advance terrorists is not legal. That is a clear (and IMO acceptable) distinction. The OP article doesnt mention that anywhere. The OP article makes it seem like he was encrypting a bunch of cookie recipes.\nsoapgoat: article is very clickbait, doesnt even describe whats actually going onthe person in question is an Isis suspect on a watchlist, caught concealing Isis data, and charged with training and using encryption to aid terrorism... he was literally trying to set up communication channels for Isis. not just some blog.\nsnotfart: For such a short article, there is a lot of conjecture going on in it.  Very few details of the actual case and a lot of probablys and presumablys.Also, He was also charged with having a flash drive in a cufflink with a bootable operating system...  There is no such offence as that.\nweltraumzauber: Ars Technica quotes it like this:Im pretty sure, the terrorism part is the crucial point here.\najehals: And the other point to note is that for quite a while  for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation, or instigation of terrorism. requires the prosecution to show evidence of a specific terrorist act, not just some vague potential (I think that was established with the whole lyrical terrorist thing).That isnt to say that there arent still potential issues around the chilling effects of such legislation.. Although as others have said, prosecutions and convictions need to be tied to terrorism, and dont stand on their own. As was argued at the time, a train timetable is useful for the preparation, or instigation of terrorism, bit without the connection to the planned commission of an act, it would be so broad as to make everyone guilty.. Oddly enough UK courts dont like that and so we have several rulings on it..Oh, and Hi Rick, hope all is well!\nDaSpawn: how do they equate security with terrorism?  what exactly did that USB device do?the problem is they are implying malicious actions because he posses computer thingsand they said the magic word, terrorism, and you went right along with it\nQuantumWarrior: Either this blog neglects vital details to make a dramatic article, or what is talked about is just made up nonsense.You can be worried about privacy and not resort to ridiculous claims like someone could be jailed in the UK for carrying astronomical noise data.Consider as well that none of the claims made in the article have ever been tested in court, nobody has been arrested solely for carrying such data, or for refusing to decrypt whatever encrypted files they had. It would be quite funny to see someone get prosecuted for either though, the lawyer and judge would have a field day challenging such bullshit legislation.\nMagicGin: I dont think this is a  claim. If you can be compelled to give up a password and face jail time without it, then its ostensibly possible for an individual to be accused of hiding encrypted data simply for having digital junk on their harddrive. All that needs to happen is that a sufficient case needs to be mounted that an individual has encrypted data, and accordingly their inability to produce a password can be viewed as a violation of the law.  and while deniability should be an absolute defense, more egregious things have been seen in the UK courts.To suggest its ridiculous for this kind of thing to happen ignores the reality that the courts (and judges) are not infallible. The reasonable standard is all well and good as long as the judge actually knows the subject well enough to judge reasonable, which as we have seen countless times is not the case for tech/privacy cases.The article linked certainly makes a lot of noisy and self-serving assumptions, but the law to compel the surrender of an encryption key is still nonsense. All it takes is a false assumption (or casual malice) to promptly shove whoever in jail. The UK has super aggressive laws about this kind of thing.\nMatiasVellerman: Exactly.  Everyone is talking shit about how https is terrorism but thats literally just a guess.  \njudgej2: If Theresa May has her way, there will be a life sentence for the offence of, she just knows hes a bad un.\nvalax: A VPN provider creating bullshit fear-mongering articles? I wonder why theyd do that....\nTheBestWifesHusband: Aha, id been wondering why we were simultaneously funding terrorists abroad while hyping the whole terrorist concept at home.makes sense now.\nGeminii27: To provide lots of juicy targets to justify anti-terrorist budgets?\nphilip1201: Sure, but in this context its about ensuring a vague and ever-present threat to justify completely dismantling the privacy of citizens, enabling the suppression of dissent (like the pointing out of inconvenient facts) by governments and private organisations.\nreonhato99: Clickbait title. The charges are all terrorist related.He is basically accused of training terrorists on how to encrypt and hide their data.He wasnt charged for having a USB with an OS on it, he was charged because the allegation is the OS was for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation, or instigation of terrorism.He also had a book and data on missiles and missile guidance systems which again is alleged to be have been used for terrorist related things.TLDR: he has been charged for helping terrorists, not for encrypting.\nwithabeard: Youre mis-representing the article here (IMO).He hasnt been charged for helping terrorists.He has been charged for having an encrypted blog. The reason authorities have chosen to charge him, is because that blog may contain material that helps terrorists. The distinction is small, but it has a massive impact on how we apply laws in the UK.Helping other people conduce killing of other humans is already illegal in the UK, so that is what he should be charged with if there is evidence he did it.But he has  been charged withIt shouldnt matter what the encryption was going to be used for, no-one should ever be charged with doing that.[edit] Seems Im mis-representing the actual charges here and what I want is exactly what theyre doing. \nreonhato99: You left an important part out.\nwithabeard: Then charge the guy for conspiracy to murder (for example, IANAL).I use encryption every day, I train our staff how to use encryption every day. Whatever the use of the encryption should not be illegal. The murder should be.[edit] Otherwise what do we do, only apply the law when we decide up front the person is a bad man? Do we now just ignore that I train people in using encryption, but thats fine because my nan says Im a nice boy?[edit] Seems what I want is exactly what theyre doing. \nXkF21WNJ: According to the  the actual charges are:Still pretty damn shady (if anything they show that you can be accused of terrorism for damn near anything) but the actual charges are not entirely idiotic. The justification is a hell of a stretch, but thats something for the courts to figure out.\nhesh582: What?He was charged with a terrorist offense.  The encryption was part of it, but the purpose of terrorism bit is why it was criminal.  Training someone to use encryption for non-terrorist purposes is not illegal.Replace encryption with gun.  Its not illegal to train someone to use a gun  (though there are obviously regulations there).  It is illegal to train a terrorist to use a gun for terrorism.The use of encryption is  illegal.  The use of encryption for terrorism  illegal.  Theres a huge difference there.  You arent avoiding prosecution because youre a nice boy, youre avoiding prosecution because you arent aiding terrorists.  Can you really not see how huge of a difference that is?Encryption is just one of many, many things you could use to help a terrorist and get charged for it.  Providing a friend housing is not illegal.  Providing a friend with housing so that they have a place to stage terrorist attacks  illegal.\npepe_le_shoe: Our definition of terrorism is also surprisingly wooly, so theres that too. The point, as always, is that our laws are written in such a way that they could be abused if the government so choose. That they dont (debatable) is not a justification for vague laws. \nmiddlemanmark: Without knowing the nature of the blog in question its impossible to see which side we should be supporting.Edit: hes accused of being an ISIS supporter. So the article is misleading, this isnt some blog where hes taking pictures of pancakes. \nPhyltre: ...but isnt that an accusation anyone can make towards anyone else, at any time?\ncsgregwer: You can always make an accusation. This is why the courts require evidence.Do you think a court would accept any of this without  to give probable cause or reasonable suspicion that his actions were terrorist related?\nhesh582: Sure.  But if that accusation is substantiated (for instance here by a blog full of terrorist stuff, manuals on missile making, etc), well...\ntehbored: Thats sounds much more reasonable, but do you have a source? \nredem: That blog links to  as its source, which covers some of the detail you wanted.\nRoboticide: Ars Technica doesnt mention the missiles, but they are the original source, they point out the man was an ISIS suspect, and they mention nothing about https.  That was bullshit made up by this article.\nTheQueefGoblin: Very misleading and blatantly clickbaity title, and also a pretty garbage article. The guy wasnt arrested simply for using encryption. Hes a suspected member of ISIS and is suspected of using the materials Its not like they just lifted the first guy they found using a live-bootable version of Linux.The article doesnt even confirm that he was running a blog over HTTPS - it says . This article is fucking clown shoes.\nBokbreath: No, he was charged with terrorism. The cryptography is an aggravating factor. If they dont prove terrorism connections then hell walk.\nFalkvinge: According to Ars:I.e. researching encryption, teaching encryption, and using HTTPS on the blog is  an act of preparing for terrorism, in this case. The difference is enormous to if it were just a severity circumstance.Edit/Add: Also, following industry best practices - how on this green Earth did Scotland Yard smoke that up to being an aggravating factor, doing everything by the book (which is indeed cited as aggravating factor in another of the six charges)?\nBokbreath: Its only preparation if they can prove a terrorism connection. This is like someone being charged with firearms offences as an adjunct to, say, assaut. Its not illegal to carry a weapon but if you have one when you commit an offence it is an aggravating circumstance. Im gonna go out on a limb and state I believe that is the case here.\nName0fTheUser: IMHO its like the police finding bleach in a terrorists kitchen cupboard. Yes, it could be used as an ingredient for a bomb, but its also a perfectly normal and legal thing to own.\nFalkvinge: Of course its only preparing to commit an act of terrorism if they can prove that specific charge. But do note that the charge still stands on its own, in terms of the actions listed.Youre making the assumption that violence or something we normally associate with the word terrorism is involved here. That assumption is not valid.This is the country where peaceful protests outside the London Stock Exchange  low-level terrorism.\n1s44c: There have been a great number of stupid things classed as terrorism in the UK. There were plenty of stories about councils using anti-terror laws to install hidden cameras in order to find and fine people who didnt fully close their trash bins.\nput_on_the_mask: Which country is that - America? That article is about New York.\ntogamgurga: That article had absolutely nothing to do with the UK. Its the NYPD Commissioner saying that. And not about peaceful protests outside the London Stock Exchange.\nTony49UK: Its an ISIS blog and the person may already be subject to a control order, which would limit their right to use mobiles, computers and the internet, as well as where they can go and who they can meet with.  Its highly unlikely that this would apply to a normal person.\nput_on_the_mask: I can see how youve arrived at that conclusion, but its not correct. If he was not engaged in a pattern of terrorism-related activities and there was no evidence that this blog were intended for the sharing of terrorist training materials, the terrorism acts do not apply and there are no charges. They cannot point at an encrypted blog and say thats encrypted, it must be a terrorist page - they need to demonstrate links to terrorism without the encrypted material, and even then for the charges to stick they would have to demonstrate sufficient reason to suspect that the encrypted material is terror related. Absolutely nothing about this case or the legislation being used characterises the use of encryption in itself as an act of terrorism.\njl2352: Its crazy how many people on Reddit will take a small part of a story, and push it as though its 100% of the picture.\naf22man: Just because the connection is encrypted, doesnt mean that its private information. I mean hes posting it on a Blog so its going to be public information anyway. It just means that when he post the information that it is going to be non interceptable from his computer to the public blog. This is an asinine case of idiocy\nshsks: So heres an actual list of the charges. It seems hes not being charged specifically for encryption being a terrorist act and teaching it, but for encrypting articles he is using to support terrorism and teaching encryption for the purpose of assisting terrorism.I.e. the encryption isnt the problem, its what he was encrypting and why he was doing it.\ncarnizzle: And there was me thinking the guy had been arrested for the missile guidance datasheets and isis handbooks he was spreading about. \n_johngalt: Witch hunting 2016 style.We dont understand it, burn it\ndonaldtroll: The whole world is turning fascist again, and I am scared for the people who are young today\nbelonii:    \nObski: Next week: All mail and packages must now be delivered in transparent envelopes\nineedmoneysp: This article so misrepresents what this man was arrested for. It only talks about the encryption making it seems like he was arrested for terrorism because he researched encryption and encrypted his blog and taught other how to encrypt. That is only a very tiny part of what he was really arrested for. He professed to belong to a proscribed organization namely ISIS and has a lot of other charges for terrorism. He used encryption but wasnt arrested for using it. Its not illegal from what I looked up in the UK to research or use encryption. This article is shit. When I looked up info on this I got this link: \nIt is the same link i eventually saw further down in the comments by Azthal. He also has the terrorism Act of 2006 if you want to look through that too. \nelfdom: Here is the actual list of charges. .The relevant laws:Those laws are  as long as anything relates to the purpose of terrorism. Note in particular that section 5 and section 6 relate to  act or skill and section 57 has parts that require you to prove you are  in possession or know the presence of a thing for the purpose of terrorism.\nxh0dx: Very little information about this case on the actual site linked, not sure if that is just because the trial is new and not much facts have been divulged yet or because the author is trying to produce a clickbait title to drive traffic to his site.Without knowing the facts or history behind this I can only assume that one of the factors in the charge is the accused persons actions, is it an offence to produce an encryted item? No but it could prove criminal intent to carry out or promote/train persons in terrorists actions when brought in with other evidence that will come out during the trial. Simple comparison, its not an offence in scotland to walk down the street with a golf club but you walk down a busy high street whilst drunk and swinging said golf club above your head shouting aggressively at people and it becomes one. \nNovarest: Thats OK. British citizens can get justice by appealing at European Co... Oh wait. \nChrisMusix: V for Vendetta happening in our time. \nvelvetshark: As an American, I am absolutely relieved that another nations government is saying something stupid for once. \nRyunosukeKusanagi: \nyussi_divnal: IANAL, but theres a misleading title.\nHis charges are related to knowingly assisting a terrorist organisation. its very different to what the article says. its illegal to help terrorists, not to teach encryption. if he was teaching them jujitsu, he would be charged just the same.\nRabidJumpingChipmunk: The actual charges: After reading the charges, Im no longer concerned that encryption or researching encryption is being criminalized. This is akin to a terrorist training camp being shut down and claiming that teaching people to run and shoot is now illegal. There is a distinct difference and I believe its contained in the wording of the charges. It seems as though people would rather wait until after a crime or act of terrorism has been committed to arrest the individual, because otherwise, no crime has been committed! Im wary of law enforcement overstepping their bounds, but this was not such a case. I wont be needing this pitchfork... \nZaldir: Definition of a clickbait title...\nRafahil: I use a Chrome app called HTTPS Everywhere. This makes all sites in the world a terrorist site.\nrazuliserm: it only makes sites default to HTTPS if they have the protocol enabled on their end. \nHaYuFlyDisTang: More specifically, website owners must buy an SSL certificate which gives access to the more secure https connection. HTTPSEverywhere ensures that you always are on the https version of a website when it is available. If it is not available then you will be on plain old http\nAvamander: No buying any more. We have letsencrypt.\nozzyfox: It doesnt quite work like that.\ninsufferably_smug: It really doesnt, but its understandable how Everywhere leads a layman to the wrong conclusion. Its a pretty misleading name.\nShaper_pmp: Scotland Yard says nothing of the sort.Scotland Yard says  (or supporting/training those who are), then they can  charge you for attempting to avoid detection by making use of encryption .Encryption is not illegal, or criminally indicative of terrorist activities.However, using encryption   illegal, and thats what the guys being charged with.That requires reading whole sentences before forming opinions though, and doesnt stir up juicy controversy that generates online page-views.\n(17 children): \nFalkvinge:  added you to the list Edit/Add: Ok, downvotes here because the reference isnt understood. Theres a Theresa May bot on Twitter that does exactly this to people discussing privacy topics, adding them to lists with this kind of name, in a way that they see it happen publicly.More here .\nRed8Coder: Wrongthinkers \u2122 \nVault111Survivor: Article written by founder of the pirate party. HUGE pinch of salt. Nowhere in that article did anyone but the writer say writing a blog in HTTPS is illegal.\nkindafunnylookin: ITT: People who didnt read the article but have something amusing to say about it anyway.\n',
